PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -1-                               25 August 2023
                                    Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



1      Scope
       The manufacture of sterile products covers a wide range of sterile product types
       (active substance, excipient, primary packaging material and finished dosage
       form), packed sizes (single unit to multiple units), processes (from highly
       automated systems to manual processes) and technologies (e.g. biotechnology,
       classical small molecule manufacturing systems and closed systems). This
       Annex provides general guidance that should be used in the design and control
       of facilities, equipment, systems and procedures used for the manufacture of all
       sterile products applying the principles of Quality Risk Management (QRM), to
       ensure that microbial, particulate and endotoxin/pyrogen contamination is
       prevented in the final product.

       QRM applies to this document in its entirety and will not, normally, be referred to
       in specific paragraphs. Where specific limits or frequencies or ranges are
       specified, these should be considered as a minimum requirement. They are
       stated due to historical regulatory experience of issues that have been identified
       and have impacted the safety of patients.

       The intent of the Annex is to provide guidance for the manufacture of sterile
       products. However, some of the principles and guidance, such as contamination
       control strategy, design of premises, cleanroom classification, qualification,
       validation, monitoring and personnel gowning, may be used to support the
       manufacture of other products that are not intended to be sterile such as certain
       liquids, creams, ointments and low bioburden biological intermediates, but where
       the control and reduction of microbial, particulate and endotoxin/pyrogen
       contamination is considered important. Where a manufacturer elects to apply
       guidance herein to non-sterile products, the manufacturer should clearly
       document which principles have been applied and acknowledge that compliance
       with those principles should be demonstrated.


2      Principle
2.1    The manufacture of sterile products is subject to special requirements in order to
       minimize risks of microbial, particulate and endotoxin/pyrogen contamination.
       The following key areas should be considered:

       i.   Facility, equipment and process should be appropriately designed, qualified
            and/or validated and where applicable, subjected to ongoing verification
            according to the relevant sections of the Good Manufacturing Practices
            (GMP) guide. The use of appropriate technologies (e.g. Restricted Access
            Barriers Systems (RABS), isolators, robotic systems, rapid/alternative
            methods and continuous monitoring systems) should be considered to
            increase the protection of the product from potential extraneous sources of
            endotoxin/pyrogen, particulate and microbial contamination such as
            personnel, materials and the surrounding environment, and assist in the
            rapid detection of potential contaminants in the environment and the product.

      ii.   Personnel should have adequate qualifications and experience, training and
            behaviour with a specific focus on the principles involved in the protection of




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -2-                            25 August 2023
                                    Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



             sterile product during the manufacturing, packaging and distribution
             processes.

      iii.   Processes and monitoring systems for sterile product manufacture should be
             designed, commissioned, qualified, monitored and regularly reviewed by
             personnel with appropriate process, engineering and microbiological
             knowledge.

      iv.    Raw materials and packaging materials should be adequately controlled and
             tested to ensure that level of bioburden and endotoxin/pyrogen are suitable
             for use.

2.2    Processes, equipment, facilities and manufacturing activities should be managed
       in accordance with QRM principles to provide a proactive means of identifying,
       scientifically evaluating and controlling potential risks to quality. Where alternative
       approaches are used, these should be supported by appropriate rationale, risk
       assessment and mitigation, and should meet the intent of this Annex.

       In the first instance, QRM priorities should include appropriate design of the
       facility, equipment and processes, followed by the implementation of well-
       designed procedures, and finally application of monitoring systems as the
       element that demonstrates that the design and procedures have been correctly
       implemented and continue to perform in line with expectations. Monitoring or
       testing alone does not give assurance of sterility.

2.3    A Contamination Control Strategy (CCS) should be implemented across the
       facility in order to define all critical control points and assess the effectiveness of
       all the controls (design, procedural, technical and organisational) and monitoring
       measures employed to manage risks to medicinal product quality and safety. The
       combined strategy of the CCS should establish robust assurance of
       contamination prevention. The CCS should be actively reviewed and, where
       appropriate, updated and should drive continual improvement of the
       manufacturing and control methods. Its effectiveness should form part of the
       periodic management review. Where existing control systems are in place and
       are appropriately managed, these may not require replacement but should be
       referenced in the CCS and the associated interactions between systems should
       be understood.

2.4    Contamination control and steps taken to minimize the risk of contamination from
       microbial, endotoxin/pyrogen and particle sources includes a series of
       interrelated events and measures. These are typically assessed, controlled and
       monitored individually but their collective effectiveness should be considered
       together.

2.5    The development of the CCS requires detailed technical and process knowledge.
       Potential sources of contamination are attributable to microbial and cellular debris
       (e.g. pyrogen, endotoxin) as well as particulate (e.g. glass and other visible and
       sub-visible particles).

       Elements to be considered within a CCS should include (but are not limited to):

       i.    design of both the plant and processes including the associated
             documentation;


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -3-                             25 August 2023
                                      Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products




        ii.   premises and equipment;

       iii.   personnel;

       iv.    utilities;

        v.    raw material controls – including in-process controls;

       vi.    product containers and closures;

      vii.      vendor approval – such as key component suppliers, sterilisation of
              components and single use systems (SUS), and critical service providers;

      viii.   management of outsourced activities and availability/transfer of critical
              information between parties, e.g. contract sterilisation services;

       ix.    process risk management;

        x.    process validation;

       xi.    validation of sterilisation processes;

      xii.    preventative maintenance – maintaining equipment, utilities and premises
              (planned and unplanned maintenance) to a standard that will ensure there is
              no additional risk of contamination;

      xiii.   cleaning and disinfection;

      xiv.    monitoring systems - including an assessment of the feasibility of the
              introduction of scientifically sound, alternative methods that optimize the
              detection of environmental contamination;

      xv.     prevention mechanisms – trend analysis, detailed investigation, root cause
              determination, corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) and the need for
              comprehensive investigational tools;

      xvi.    continuous improvement based on information derived from the above.

2.6     The CCS should consider all aspects of contamination control with ongoing and
        periodic review resulting in updates within the pharmaceutical quality system as
        appropriate. Changes to the systems in place should be assessed for any impact
        on the CCS before and after implementation.

2.7     The manufacturer should take all steps and precautions necessary to assure the
        sterility of the products manufactured within its facilities. Sole reliance for sterility
        or other quality aspects should not be placed on any terminal process or finished
        product test.

                                    Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



3       Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS)
3.1     The manufacture of sterile products is a complex activity that requires specific
        controls and measures to ensure the quality of products manufactured.
        Accordingly, the manufacturer’s PQS should encompass and address the
        specific requirements of sterile product manufacture and ensure that all activities
        are effectively controlled so that the risk of microbial, particulate and
        endotoxin/pyrogen contamination is minimized in sterile products. In addition to
        the PQS requirements detailed in Chapter 1 of the GMP Guide (Part I – Basic
        Requirements for Medicinal Products), the PQS for sterile product manufacture
        should also ensure that:

        i.   An effective risk management system is integrated into all areas of the
             product life cycle with the aim to minimize microbial contamination and to
             ensure the quality of sterile products manufactured.

       ii.   The manufacturer has sufficient knowledge and expertise in relation to the
             products manufactured and the equipment, engineering and manufacturing
             methods employed that have an impact on product quality.

      iii.   Root cause analysis of procedural, process or equipment failure is performed
             in such a way that the risk to product is correctly identified and understood
             so that suitable corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) are implemented.

      iv.    Risk management is applied in the development and maintenance of the
             CCS, to identify, assess, reduce/eliminate (where applicable) and control
             contamination risks. Risk management should be documented and should
             include the rationale for decisions taken in relation to risk reduction and
             acceptance of residual risk.

       v.    Senior management should effectively oversee the state of control
             throughout the facility and product lifecycle. Risk management outcome
             should be reviewed regularly as part of the on-going quality management,
             during change, in the event of a significant emerging problem, and during the
             periodic product quality review.

      vi.    Processes associated with the finishing, storage and transport of sterile
             products should not compromise the sterile product. Aspects that should be
             considered include: container integrity, risks of contamination and avoidance
             of degradation by ensuring that products are stored and maintained in
             accordance with the registered storage conditions.

      vii.   Persons responsible for the certification/release of sterile products have
             appropriate access to manufacturing and quality information and possess
             adequate knowledge and experience in the manufacture of sterile products
             and the associated critical quality attributes. This is in order to allow such
             persons to determine if the sterile products have been manufactured in
             accordance with the registered specifications and approved process and are
             of the required quality.

3.2     All non-conformities, such as sterility test failures, environmental monitoring
        excursions or deviations from established procedures should be adequately



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -5-                            25 August 2023
                                   Annex 1      Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       investigated before certification/release of the batch. The investigation should
       determine the potential impact upon process and product quality and whether
       any other processes or batches are potentially impacted. The reason for including
       or excluding a product or batch from the scope of the investigation should be
       clearly justified and recorded.

4      Premises
4.1    The manufacture of sterile products should be carried out in appropriate
       cleanrooms, entry to which should be through change rooms that act as airlocks
       for personnel and airlocks for equipment and materials. Cleanrooms and change
       rooms should be maintained to an appropriate cleanliness standard and supplied
       with air which has passed through filters of an appropriate efficiency. Controls
       and monitoring should be scientifically justified and should effectively evaluate
       the state of environmental conditions of cleanrooms, airlocks and pass-through
       hatches.

4.2    The various operations of component preparation, product preparation and filling
       should be carried out with appropriate technical and operational separation
       measures within the cleanroom or facility to prevent mix up and contamination.

4.3    Restricted Access Barrier Systems (RABS) or isolators are beneficial in assuring
       required conditions and minimizing microbial contamination associated with
       direct human interventions in the critical zone. Their use should be considered in
       the CCS. Any alternative approaches to the use of RABS or isolators should be
       justified.

4.4    For the manufacture of sterile products there are four grades of cleanroom/zone.
      Grade A: The critical zone for high-risk operations (e.g. aseptic processing line,
      filling zone, stopper bowl, open primary packaging or for making aseptic
      connections under the protection of first air). Normally, such conditions are
      provided by a localised airflow protection, such as unidirectional airflow
      workstations within RABS or isolators. The maintenance of unidirectional airflow
      should be demonstrated and qualified across the whole of the grade A area.
      Direct intervention (e.g. without the protection of barrier and glove port
      technology) into the grade A area by operators should be minimized by premises,
      equipment, process and procedural design.
      Grade B: For aseptic preparation and filling, this is the background cleanroom for
      grade A (where it is not an isolator). Air pressure differences should be
      continuously monitored. Cleanrooms of lower grade than grade B can be
      considered where isolator technology is used (see paragraph 4.20).
      Grade C and D: These are cleanrooms used for carrying out less critical
      stages in the manufacture of aseptically filled sterile products or as a
      background for isolators. They can also be used for the preparation/filling of
      terminally sterilised products. (See section 8 for the specific details on terminal
      sterilisation activities).

4.5   In cleanrooms and critical zones, all exposed surfaces should be smooth,
      impervious and unbroken in order to minimize the shedding or accumulation of
      particles or micro-organisms.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -6-                            25 August 2023
                                    Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products




4.6    To reduce accumulation of dust and to facilitate cleaning there should be no
       recesses that are difficult to clean effectively, therefore projecting ledges,
       shelves, cupboards and equipment should be kept to a minimum. Doors should
       be designed to avoid recesses that cannot be cleaned. Sliding doors may be
       undesirable for this reason.

4.7    Materials used in cleanrooms, both in the construction of the room and for items
       used within the room, should be selected to minimize generation of particles and
       to permit the repeated application of cleaning, disinfectant and sporicidal agents
       where used.

4.8    Ceilings should be designed and sealed to prevent contamination from the space
       above them.

4.9    Sinks and drains should be prohibited in the grade A and grade B areas. In other
       cleanrooms, air breaks should be fitted between the machine or sink and the
       drains. Floor drains in lower grade cleanrooms should be fitted with traps or water
       seals designed to prevent back flow and should be regularly cleaned, disinfected
       and maintained.

4.10   The transfer of equipment and materials into and out of the cleanrooms and
       critical zones is one of the greatest potential sources of contamination. Any
       activities with the potential to compromise the cleanliness of cleanrooms or the
       critical zone should be assessed and if they cannot be eliminated, appropriate
       controls should be implemented.

4.11   The transfer of materials, equipment, and components into the grade A or B areas
       should be carried out via a unidirectional process. Where possible, items should
       be sterilised and passed into these areas through double-ended sterilisers (e.g.
       through a double-door autoclave or depyrogenation oven/tunnel) sealed into the
       wall. Where sterilisation upon transfer of the items is not possible, a procedure
       which achieves the same objective of not introducing contamination should be
       validated and implemented, (e.g. using an effective transfer disinfection process,
       rapid transfer systems for isolators or, for gaseous or liquid materials, a bacteria-
       retentive filter). The removal of items from the grade A and B areas (e.g.
       materials, waste, environmental samples) should be carried out via a separate
       unidirectional process. If this is not possible, time-based separation of movement
       (incoming/exiting material) by procedure should be considered and controls
       applied to avoid potential contamination of incoming items.

4.12   Airlocks should be designed and used to provide physical separation and to
       minimize microbial and particle contamination of the different areas and should
       be present for material and personnel moving between different grades.
       Wherever possible, airlocks used for personnel movement should be separated
       from those used for material movement. Where this is not practical, time-based
       separation of movement (personnel/material) by procedure should be
       considered. Airlocks should be flushed effectively with filtered air to ensure that
       the grade of the cleanroom is maintained. The final stage of the airlock should, in
       the “at rest” state, be of the same cleanliness grade (viable and total particle) as
       the cleanroom into which it leads. The use of separate change rooms for entering
       and leaving the grade B area is desirable. Where this is not practical, time-based
       separation of activities (ingress/egress) by procedure should be considered.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -7-                            25 August 2023
                                       Annex 1      Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       Where the CCS indicates that the risk of contamination is high, separate change
       rooms for entering and leaving production areas should be used. Airlocks should
       be designed as follows:

       i.      Personnel airlocks: Areas of increasing cleanliness used for entry of
               personnel (e.g. from the grade D area to the grade C area to the grade B
               area). In general hand washing facilities should be provided only in the first
               stage of the changing room and not be present in changing rooms directly
               accessing the grade B area.

       ii.     Material airlocks: used for materials and equipment transfer.

              Only materials and equipment that have been included on an approved list
               and assessed during validation of the transfer process, should be transferred
               into the grade A or grade B areas via an airlock or pass-through hatches.
               Equipment and materials (intended for use in the grade A area) should be
               protected when transiting through the grade B area. Any unapproved items
               that require transfer should be pre-approved as an exception. Appropriate
               risk assessment and mitigation measures should be applied and recorded as
               per the manufacturer's CCS and should include a specific disinfection and
               monitoring programme approved by quality assurance.

              Pass-through hatches should be designed to protect the higher-grade
               environment, for example by effective flushing with an active filtered air
               supply.

              The movement of material or equipment from lower grade or unclassified
               area to higher grade clean areas should be subject to cleaning and
               disinfection commensurate with the risk and in line with the CCS.

4.13   For pass-through hatches and airlocks (for material and personnel), the entry and
       exit doors should not be opened simultaneously. For airlocks leading to the
       grade A and grade B areas, an interlocking system should be used. For airlocks
       leading to grade C and D areas, a visual and/or audible warning system should
       be operated as a minimum. Where required to maintain area segregation, a time
       delay between the closing and opening of interlocked doors should be
       established.

4.14   Cleanrooms should be supplied with a filtered air supply that maintains a positive
       pressure and/or an airflow relative to the background environment of a lower
       grade under all operational conditions and should flush the area effectively.
       Adjacent rooms of different grades should have an air pressure difference of a
       minimum of 10 Pascals (guidance value). Particular attention should be paid to
       the protection of the critical zone. The recommendations regarding air supplies
       and pressures may need to be modified where it is necessary to contain certain
       materials (e.g. pathogenic, highly toxic or radioactive products or live viral or
       bacterial materials). The modification may include positively or negatively
       pressurized airlocks that prevent the hazardous material from contaminating
       surrounding areas. Decontamination of facilities (e.g. the cleanrooms and the
       heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems) and the treatment of
       air leaving a clean area, may be necessary for some operations. Where
       containment requires air to flow into a critical zone, the source of the air should



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -8-                              25 August 2023
                                      Annex 1      Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       be from an area of the same or higher grade.

4.15   Airflow patterns within cleanrooms and zones should be visualised to
       demonstrate that there is no ingress from lower grade to higher grade areas and
       that air does not travel from less clean areas (such as the floor) or over operators
       or equipment that may transfer contamination to the higher-grade areas. Where
       unidirectional airflow is required, visualisation studies should be performed to
       determine compliance, (see paragraphs 4.4 & 4.19). When filled, closed products
       are transferred to an adjacent cleanroom of a lower grade via a small egress
       point, airflow visualization studies should demonstrate that air does not ingress
       from the lower grade cleanrooms to the grade B area. Where air movement is
       shown to be a contamination risk to the clean area or critical zone, corrective
       actions, such as design improvement, should be implemented. Airflow pattern
       studies should be performed both at rest and in operation (e.g. simulating
       operator interventions). Video recordings of the airflow patterns should be
       retained. The outcome of the air visualisation studies should be documented and
       considered when establishing the facility's environmental monitoring programme.

4.16   Indicators of air pressure differences should be fitted between cleanrooms and/or
       between isolators and their background. Set-points and the criticality of air
       pressure differences should be considered within the CCS. Air pressure
       differences identified as critical should be continuously monitored and recorded.
       A warning system should be in place to instantly indicate and warn operators of
       any failure in the air supply or reduction of air pressure differences (below set
       limits for those identified as critical). The warning signal should not be overridden
       without assessment and a procedure should be available to outline the steps to
       be taken when a warning signal is given. Where alarm delays are set, these
       should be assessed and justified within the CCS. Other air pressure differences
       should be monitored and recorded at regular intervals.

4.17   Facilities should be designed to permit observation of production activities from
       outside the grade A and B areas (e.g. through the provision of windows or remote
       cameras with a full view of the area and processes to allow observation and
       supervision without entry). This requirement should be considered when
       designing new facilities or during refurbishment of existing facilities.


BARRIER TECHNOLOGIES

4.18   Isolators or RABS, which are different technologies, and the associated
       processes, should be designed to provide protection through separation of the
       grade A environment from the environment of the surrounding room. The hazards
       introduced from entry or removal of items during processing should be minimized
       and supported by high capability transfer technologies or validated systems that
       robustly prevent contamination and are appropriate for the respective technology.

4.19   The design of the technology and processes used should ensure appropriate
       conditions are maintained in the critical zone to protect the exposed product
       during operations.

       i.     Isolators:

            a. The design of open isolators should ensure grade A conditions with first air


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -9-                            25 August 2023
                                         Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



                protection in the critical zone and unidirectional airflow that sweeps over and
                away from exposed products during processing.
             b. The design of closed isolators should ensure grade A conditions with
                adequate protection for exposed products during processing. Airflow may not
                be fully unidirectional in closed isolators where simple operations are
                conducted. However, any turbulent airflow should not increase risk of
                contamination of the exposed product. Where processing lines are included
                in closed isolators, grade A conditions should be ensured with first air
                protection in the critical zone and unidirectional airflow that sweeps over and
                away from exposed products during processing.
             c. Negative pressure isolators should only be used when containment of the
                product is considered essential (e.g. radiopharmaceutical products) and
                specialized risk control measures should be applied to ensure the critical
                zone is not compromised.

       ii.      RABS:

                The design of RABS should ensure grade A conditions with unidirectional
                airflow and first air protection in the critical zone. A positive airflow from the
                critical zone to the supporting background environment should be
                maintained.

4.20   The background environment for isolators or RABS should ensure the risk of
       transfer of contamination is minimized.

       i.       Isolators:

             a. The background environment for open isolators should generally correspond
                to a minimum of grade C. The background for closed isolators should
                correspond to a minimum of grade D. The decision on the background
                classification should be based on risk assessment and justified in the CCS.
             b. Key considerations when performing the risk assessment for the CCS of an
                isolator should include (but are not limited to); the bio-decontamination
                programme, the extent of automation, the impact of glove manipulations that
                may potentially compromise ‘first air’ protection of critical process points, the
                impact of potential loss of barrier/glove integrity, transfer mechanisms used
                and activities such as set-up or maintenance that may require the doors to
                be opened prior to the final bio-decontamination of the isolator. Where
                additional process risks are identified, a higher grade of background should
                be considered unless appropriately justified in the CCS.
             c. Airflow pattern studies should be performed at the interfaces of open
                isolators to demonstrate the absence of air ingress.

       ii.      RABS:

                The background environment for RABS used for aseptic processing, should
                correspond to a minimum of grade B and airflow pattern studies should be
                performed to demonstrate the absence of air ingress during interventions,
                including door openings if applicable.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                            -10-                             25 August 2023
                                       Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



4.21   The materials used for glove systems (for both isolators and RABS) should be
       demonstrated to have appropriate mechanical and chemical resistance. The
       frequency of glove replacement should be defined within the CCS.

       i.      Isolators:

             a. For isolators, leak testing of the glove system should be performed using a
                methodology demonstrated to be suitable for the task and criticality. The
                testing should be performed at defined intervals. Generally glove integrity
                testing should be performed at a minimum frequency of the beginning and
                end of each batch or campaign. Additional glove integrity testing may be
                necessary depending on the validated campaign length.
               Glove integrity monitoring should include a visual inspection associated with
               each use and following any manipulation that may affect the integrity of the
               system.
               For manual aseptic processing activities where single unit or small batch
               sizes are produced, the frequency of integrity verification may be based on
               other criteria, such as the beginning and end of each manufacturing session.
             b. Integrity / leak testing of isolator systems should be performed at defined
                intervals.

       ii.     RABS:

               For RABS, gloves used in the grade A area should be sterilised before
               installation and sterilised or effectively bio-decontaminated by a validated
               method prior to each manufacturing campaign. If exposed to the background
               environment during operation, disinfection using an approved methodology
               following each exposure should be completed. Gloves should be visually
               examined with each use, and integrity testing should be performed at
               periodic intervals.

4.22   Decontamination methods (cleaning and bio-decontamination, and where
       applicable inactivation for biological materials) should be appropriately defined
       and controlled. The cleaning process prior to the bio-decontamination step is
       essential; any residues that remain may inhibit the effectiveness of the
       decontamination process. Evidence should also be available to demonstrate that
       the cleaning and bio-decontamination agents used do not have adverse impact
       on the product produced within the RABS or isolator.

       i.      For isolators

               The bio-decontamination process of the interior should be automated,
               validated and controlled within defined cycle parameters and should include
               a sporicidal agent in a suitable form (e.g. gaseous or vaporized form). Gloves
               should be appropriately extended with fingers separated to ensure contact
               with the agent. Methods used (cleaning and sporicidal bio-decontamination)
               should render the interior surfaces and critical zone of the isolator free from
               viable microorganisms.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -11-                            25 August 2023
                                            Annex 1      Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



         ii.      For RABS

               The sporicidal disinfection should include the routine application of a sporicidal
               agent using a method that has been validated and demonstrated to robustly
               include all areas of the interior surfaces and ensure a suitable environment for
               aseptic processing.


CLEANROOM AND CLEAN AIR EQUIPMENT QUALIFICATION

4.23     Cleanrooms and clean air equipment such as unidirectional airflow units (UDAFs),
         RABS and isolators, used for the manufacture of sterile products, should be
         qualified according to the required characteristics of the environment. Each
         manufacturing operation requires an appropriate environmental cleanliness level
         in the operational state in order to minimize the risk of contamination of the product
         or materials being handled. Appropriate cleanliness levels in the “at rest” and
         “operational” states should be maintained.

4.24     Cleanrooms and clean air equipment should be qualified using methodology in
         accordance with the requirements of Annex 15. Cleanroom qualification (including
         classification) should be clearly differentiated from operational environmental
         monitoring.

4.25     Cleanroom and clean air equipment qualification is the overall process of
         assessing the level of compliance of a classified cleanroom or clean air
         equipment with its intended use. As part of the qualification requirements of
         Annex 15, the qualification of cleanrooms and clean air equipment should include
         (where relevant to the design/operation of the installation):

          i.      installed filter system leakage and integrity testing,

         ii.      airflow tests - volume and velocity,

        iii.      air pressure difference test,

        iv.       airflow direction test and visualisation,

         v.       microbial airborne and surface contamination,

        vi.       temperature measurement test,

       viii.      recovery test,

        ix.       containment leak test.

       Reference for the qualification of the cleanrooms and clean air equipment can be
       found in the ISO 14644 series of standards.

4.26     Cleanroom classification is part of the cleanroom qualification and is a method of
         assessing the level of air cleanliness against a specification for a cleanroom or
         clean air equipment by measuring the total particle concentration. Classification


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                              -12-                            25 August 2023

          activities should be scheduled and performed in order to avoid any impact on
          process or product quality. For example, initial classification should be performed
          during simulated operations and reclassification performed during simulated
          operations or during aseptic process simulation (APS).

4.27      For cleanroom classification, the total of particles equal to or greater than 0.5 and
          5 µm should be measured. This measurement should be performed both at rest
          and in simulated operations in accordance with the limits specified in Table 1.

(a)
       Classification including 5µm particles may be considered where indicated by the
       CCS or historical trends.
(b)
       For grade D, in operation limits are not predetermined. The manufacturer should
       establish in operation limits based on a risk assessment and routine data where
       applicable.

4.28      For classification of the cleanroom, the minimum number of sampling locations
          and their positioning can be found in ISO 14644 Part 1. For the aseptic processing
          area and the background environment (the grade A and grade B areas,
          respectively), additional sample locations should be considered and all critical
          processing areas such as the point of fill and container closure feeder bowls
          should be evaluated. Critical processing locations should be determined by
          documented risk assessment and knowledge of the process and operations to
          be performed in the area.

4.29      Cleanroom classification should be carried out in the “at rest” and “in operation”
          states.

          i.    The definition of “at rest” state is the condition whereby the installation of all
                the utilities is complete including any functioning HVAC, with the main
                manufacturing equipment installed as specified but not operating and without
                personnel present in the room.

         ii.    The definition of “in operation” state is the condition where the installation of
                the cleanroom is complete, the HVAC system fully operational, equipment
                installed and functioning in the manufacturer’s defined operating mode with
                the maximum number of personnel present performing or simulating routine
                operational work.

         iii.   The total particle limits given in Table 1 above for the “at rest” state should
                be achieved after a “clean up” period on completion of operations and line
                clearance/cleaning activities. The "clean up" period (guidance value of less


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                            -13-                              25 August 2023
                                           Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



                than 20 minutes) should be determined during the qualification of the rooms,
                documented and adhered to in procedures to reinstate a qualified state of
                cleanliness if disrupted during operation.

4.30        The speed of air supplied by unidirectional airflow systems should be clearly
            justified in the qualification protocol including the location for air speed
            measurement. Air speed should be designed, measured and maintained to
            ensure that appropriate unidirectional air movement provides protection of the
            product and open components at the working position (e.g. where high-risk
            operations occur and where product and/or components are exposed).
            Unidirectional airflow systems should provide a homogeneous air speed in a
            range of 0.36 – 0.54 m/s (guidance value) at the working position, unless
            otherwise scientifically justified in the CCS. Airflow visualization studies should
            correlate with the air speed measurement.

4.31        The microbial contamination level of the cleanrooms should be determined as
            part of the cleanroom qualification. The number of sampling locations should be
            based on a documented risk assessment and the results obtained from room
            classification, air visualization studies and knowledge of the process and
            operations to be performed in the area. The maximum limits for microbial
            contamination during qualification for each grade are given in Table 2.
            Qualification should include both “at rest” and “in operation” states.

Table 2: Maximum permitted microbial contamination level during qualification

       a)    Settle plates should be exposed for the duration of operations and changed as required
             after a maximum of 4 hours. Exposure time should be based on recovery studies and
             should not allow desiccation of the media used.

       Note 1:      All methods indicated for a specific grade in the table should be used for qualifying
                    the area of that specific grade. If one of the methods tabulated is not used, or
                    alternative methods are used, the approach taken should be appropriately
                    justified.

       Note 2:      Limits are applied using CFU throughout the document. If different or new
                    technologies are used that present results in a manner different from CFU, the
                    manufacturer should scientifically justify the limits applied and where possible
                    correlate them to CFU.

       Note 3:      For the qualification of personnel gowning, the limits given for contact plates and
                    glove prints in Table 6 should apply.

       Note 4:      Sampling methods should not pose a risk of contamination to the manufacturing
                    operations.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                               -14-                               25 August 2023
                                         Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



4.32    The requalification of cleanrooms and clean air equipment should be carried out
        periodically following defined procedures. The requalification should include at a
        minimum the following:

         i.   cleanroom classification (total particle concentration),
         ii. integrity test of final filters,
         iii. airflow volume measurement,
        iv. verification of air pressure difference between rooms, and
         v. air velocity test
        (Note: For grade B, C and D the air velocity test should be performed according
        to a risk assessment documented as part of the CCS. However, it is required for
        filling zones supplied with unidirectional airflow (e.g. when filling terminally
        sterilised products or background to grade A and RABS). For grades with non-
        unidirectional airflow, a measurement of recovery testing should replace velocity
        testing).

        The maximum time interval for requalification of grade A & B areas, is 6 months.
        The maximum time interval for requalification of grade C & D areas, is 12 months.

        Appropriate requalification consisting of at least the above tests should also be
        carried out following completion of remedial action implemented to rectify an out
        of compliance equipment or facility condition or after changes to equipment,
        facility or processes as appropriate. The significance of a change should be
        determined through the change management process. Examples of changes to
        be considered include but are not limited to the following:

        i.    interruption of air movement which affects the operation of the installation,
       ii.    change in the design of the cleanroom or of the operational setting
              parameters of the HVAC system,
       iii.   special maintenance which affects the operation of the installation (e.g.
              change of final filters).


DISINFECTION

4.33    The disinfection of cleanrooms is particularly important. They should be cleaned
        and disinfected thoroughly in accordance with a written programme. For
        disinfection to be effective, prior cleaning to remove surface contamination should
        be performed. Cleaning programmes should effectively remove disinfectant
        residues. More than one type of disinfecting agent should be employed to ensure
        that where they have different modes of action, their combined usage is effective
        against bacteria and fungi. Disinfection should include the periodic use of a
        sporicidal agent. Monitoring should be undertaken regularly in order to assess
        the effectiveness of the disinfection programme and to detect changes in types
        of microbial flora (e.g. organisms resistant to the disinfection regime currently in
        use).

4.34    The disinfection process should be validated. Validation studies should
        demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of disinfectants in the specific


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                            -15-                            25 August 2023
                                    Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



        manner in which they are used and on the type of surface material, or
        representative material if justified, and should support the in-use expiry periods
        of prepared solutions.

4.35    Disinfectants and detergents used in grade A and grade B areas should be sterile
        prior to use. Disinfectants used in grade C and D may also be required to be
        sterile where determined in the CCS. Where the disinfectants and detergents are
        diluted / prepared by the sterile product manufacturer, this should be done in a
        manner to prevent contamination and they should be monitored for microbial
        contamination. Dilutions should be kept in previously cleaned containers (and
        sterilized where applicable) and should only be stored for the defined period. If
        the disinfectants and detergents are supplied “ready-made” then results from
        certificates of analysis or conformance can be accepted subject to successful
        completion of the appropriate vendor qualification.

4.36    Where fumigation or vapour disinfection (e.g. Vapour-phase Hydrogen Peroxide)
        of cleanrooms and associated surfaces are used, the effectiveness of any
        fumigation agent and dispersion system should be understood and validated.


5      Equipment
5.1     A written, detailed description of the equipment design should be available
        (including process and instrumentation diagrams as appropriate). This should
        form part of the initial qualification package and be kept up to date.

5.2     Equipment monitoring requirements should be defined in “user requirements
        specifications” during early stages of development, and confirmed during
        qualification. Process and equipment alarm events should be acknowledged and
        evaluated for trends. The frequency at which alarms are assessed should be
        based on their criticality (with critical alarms reviewed immediately).

5.3     As far as practicable, equipment, fittings and services should be designed and
        installed so that operations, maintenance, and repairs can be performed outside
        the cleanroom. If maintenance has to be performed in the cleanroom, and the
        required standards of cleanliness and/or asepsis cannot be maintained, then
        precautions such as restricting access to the work area to specified personnel,
        generation of clearly defined work protocols and maintenance procedures should
        be considered. Additional cleaning, disinfection and environmental monitoring
        should also be considered. If sterilisation of equipment is required, it should be
        carried out, wherever possible, after complete reassembly.

5.4     The cleaning process should be validated to be able to:

        i.    remove any residue or debris that would detrimentally impact the
              effectiveness of the disinfecting agent used,
        ii.   minimize chemical, microbial and particulate contamination of the product
              during the process and prior to disinfection.

5.5     For aseptic processes, direct and indirect product contact parts should be
        sterilised. Direct product contact parts are those that the product passes through,
        such as filling needles or pumps. Indirect product contact parts are equipment


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -16-                            25 August 2023
                                     Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       parts that do not contact the product, but may come into contact with other
       sterilised surfaces, the sterility of which is critical to the overall product sterility
       (e.g. sterilised items such as stopper bowls and guides, and sterilised
       components).

5.6    All equipment such as sterilisers, air handling systems (including air filtration) and
       water systems should be subject to qualification, monitoring and planned
       maintenance. Upon completion of maintenance, their return to use should be
       approved.

5.7    Where unplanned maintenance of equipment critical to the sterility of the product
       is to be carried out, an assessment of the potential impact to the sterility of the
       product should be performed and recorded.

5.8    A conveyor belt should not pass through a partition between a grade A or B
       area and a processing area of lower air cleanliness, unless the belt itself is
       continually sterilised (e.g. in a sterilising tunnel).

5.9    Particle counters, including sampling tubing, should be qualified. The
       manufacturer’s recommended specifications should be considered for tube
       diameter and bend radii. Tube length should typically be no longer than 1m unless
       justified and the number of bends should be minimized. Portable particle counters
       with a short length of sample tubing should be used for classification purposes.
       Isokinetic sampling heads should be used in unidirectional airflow systems. They
       should be oriented appropriately and positioned as close as possible to the critical
       location to ensure that samples are representative.


6      Utilities
6.1    The nature and extent of controls applied to utility systems should be
       commensurate with the risk to product quality associated with the utility. The
       impact should be determined via a risk assessment and documented as part of
       the CCS.

6.2    In general, higher risk utilities are those that:

       i.    directly contact product e.g. water for washing and rinsing, gases and steam
             for sterilisation,

      ii.    contact materials that will ultimately become part of the product,

      iii.   contact surfaces that come into contact with the product,

      iv.    otherwise directly impact the product.

6.3    Utilities should be designed, installed, qualified, operated, maintained and
       monitored in a manner to ensure that the utility system functions as expected.

6.4    Results for critical parameters and critical quality attributes of high risk utilities
       should be subject to regular trend analysis to ensure that system capabilities
       remain appropriate.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -17-                            25 August 2023
                                      Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products




6.5     Records of utility system installation should be maintained throughout the
        system’s life-cycle. Such records should include current drawings and schematic
        diagrams, construction material lists and system specifications. Typically,
        important information includes attributes such as:

        i.    pipeline flow direction, slopes, diameter and length,

       ii.    tank and vessel details,

       iii.   valves, filters, drains, sampling and user points,

6.6     Pipes, ducts and other utilities should not be present in cleanrooms. If
        unavoidable, then they should be installed so that they do not create recesses,
        unsealed openings and surfaces which are difficult to clean. Installation should
        allow cleaning and disinfection of outer surface of the pipes.


WATER SYSTEMS

6.7     Water treatment plant and distribution systems should be designed, constructed,
        installed, commissioned, qualified, monitored and maintained to prevent
        microbiological contamination and to ensure a reliable source of water of an
        appropriate quality. Measures should be taken to minimize the risk of presence
        of particulates, microbial contamination/proliferation and endotoxin/pyrogen (e.g.
        sloping of piping to provide complete drainage and the avoidance of dead legs).
        Where filters are included in the system, special attention should be given to their
        monitoring and maintenance. Water produced should comply with the current
        monograph of the relevant Pharmacopeia.

6.8     Water systems should be qualified and validated to maintain the appropriate
        levels of physical, chemical and microbial control, taking the effect of seasonal
        variation into account.

6.9     Water flow should remain turbulent through the pipes in water distribution
        systems to minimize the risk of microbial adhesion, and subsequent biofilm
        formation. The flow rate should be established during qualification and be
        routinely monitored.

6.10    Water for injections (WFI) should be produced from water meeting specifications
        that have been defined during the qualification process, stored and distributed in
        a manner which minimizes the risk of microbial growth (e.g. by constant
        circulation at a temperature above 70°C). WFI should be produced by distillation
        or by a purification process that is equivalent to distillation. This may include
        reverse osmosis coupled with other appropriate techniques such as
        electrodeionization (EDI), ultrafiltration or nanofiltration.

6.11    Where WFI storage tanks are equipped with hydrophobic bacteria retentive vent
        filters, the filters should not be a source of contamination and the integrity of the
        filter tested before installation and after use. Controls should be in place to
        prevent condensation formation on the filter (e.g. by heating).

6.12    To minimize the risk of biofilm formation, sterilisation, disinfection or regeneration


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -18-                            25 August 2023
                                    Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       of water systems should be carried out according to a predetermined schedule
       and as a remedial action following out-of-limit or specification results. Disinfection
       of a water system with chemicals should be followed by a validated
       rinsing/flushing     procedure.     Water        should       be     tested      after
       disinfection/regeneration. Chemical testing results should be approved before the
       water system is returned to use and microbiological/endotoxin results verified to
       be within specification and approved before batches manufactured using water
       from the system are considered for certification/release.

6.13   Regular ongoing chemical and microbial monitoring of water systems should be
       performed to ensure that the water continues to meet compendial expectations.
       Alert levels should be based on the initial qualification data and thereafter
       periodically reassessed on data obtained during subsequent re-qualifications,
       routine monitoring, and investigations. Review of ongoing monitoring data should
       be carried out to identify any adverse trend in system performance. Sampling
       programmes should reflect the requirements of the CCS and should include all
       outlets and points of use, at a specified interval, to ensure that representative
       water samples are obtained for analysis on a regular basis. Sample plans should
       be based on the qualification data, should consider the potential worst case
       sampling locations and should ensure that at least one representative sample is
       included every day of the water that is used for manufacturing processes.

6.14   Alert level excursions should be documented and reviewed, and include an
       investigation to determine whether the excursion is a single (isolated) event or if
       results are indicative of an adverse trend or system deterioration. Each action
       limit excursion should be investigated to determine the probable root causes and
       any potential impact on the quality of products and manufacturing processes as
       a result of the use of the water.

6.15   WFI systems should include continuous monitoring systems such as Total
       Organic Carbon (TOC) and conductivity, as these may give a better indication of
       overall system performance than discrete sampling. Sensor locations should be
       based on risk.


STEAM USED AS A DIRECT STERILISING AGENT

6.16   Feed water to a pure steam (clean steam) generator should be appropriately
       purified. Pure steam generators should be designed, qualified and operated in a
       manner to ensure that the quality of steam produced meets defined chemical and
       endotoxin levels.

6.17   Steam used as a direct sterilising agent should be of suitable quality and should
       not contain additives at a level which could cause contamination of product or
       equipment. For a generator supplying pure steam used for the direct sterilisation
       of materials or product-contact surfaces (e.g. porous / hard-good autoclave
       loads), steam condensate should meet the current monograph for WFI of the
       relevant Pharmacopeia (microbial testing is not mandatory for steam
       condensate). A suitable sampling schedule should be in place to ensure that
       representative pure steam is obtained for analysis on a regular basis. Other
       aspects of the quality of pure steam used for sterilisation should be assessed
       periodically against validated parameters. These parameters should include the
       following (unless otherwise justified): non-condensable gases, dryness value

       (dryness fraction) and superheat.


GASES AND VACUUM SYSTEMS

6.18   Gases that come in direct contact with the product/primary container surfaces
       should be of appropriate chemical, particulate and microbial quality. All relevant
       parameters, including oil and water content, should be specified, taking into
       account the use and type of the gas, the design of the gas generation system
       and, where applicable, comply with the current monograph of the relevant
       Pharmacopeia or the product quality requirement.

6.19   Gases used in aseptic processes should be filtered through a sterilising grade
       filter (with a nominal pore size of a maximum of 0.22 µm) at the point of use.
       Where the filter is used on a batch basis (e.g. for filtration of gas used for overlay
       of aseptically filled products) or as product vessel vent filter, then the filter should
       be integrity tested and the results reviewed as part of the batch
       certification/release process. Any transfer pipework or tubing that is located after
       the final sterilising grade filter should be sterilised. When gases are used in the
       process, microbial monitoring of the gas should be performed periodically at the
       point of use.

6.20   Where backflow from vacuum or pressure systems poses a potential risk to the
       product, there should be mechanism(s) to prevent backflow when the vacuum or
       pressure system is shut off.


HEATING AND COOLING AND HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS

6.21   Major items of equipment associated with hydraulic, heating and cooling systems
       should, where possible, be located outside the filling room. There should be
       appropriate controls to contain any spillage and/or cross contamination
       associated with the system fluids.

6.22   Any leaks from these systems that would present a risk to the product should be
       detectable (e.g. an indication system for leakage).


7      Personnel
7.1    The manufacturer should ensure that there are sufficient appropriate personnel,
       suitably qualified, trained and experienced in the manufacture and testing of
       sterile products, and any of the specific manufacturing technologies used in the
       site’s manufacturing operations, to ensure compliance with GMP applicable to
       the manufacture and handling of sterile products.

7.2    Only the minimum number of personnel required should be present in
       cleanrooms. The maximum number of operators in cleanrooms should be
       determined, documented and considered during activities such as initial
       qualification and APS, so as not to compromise sterility assurance.

7.3    All personnel including those performing cleaning, maintenance, monitoring and



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -20-                             25 August 2023
                                     Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       those that access cleanrooms should receive regular training, gowning
       qualification and assessment in disciplines relevant to the correct manufacture of
       sterile products. This training should include the basic elements of microbiology
       and hygiene, with a specific focus on cleanroom practices, contamination control,
       aseptic techniques and the protection of sterile products (for those operators
       entering the grade B cleanrooms and/or intervening into grade A) and the
       potential safety implications to the patient if the product is not sterile. The level of
       training should be based on the criticality of the function and area in which the
       personnel are working.

7.4    The personnel accessing grade A and B areas should be trained for aseptic
       gowning and aseptic behaviours. Compliance with aseptic gowning procedures
       should be confirmed by assessment and periodic reassessment at least annually,
       and should involve both visual and microbial assessment (using monitoring
       locations such as gloved fingers, forearms, chest and hood (facemask /
       forehead). See paragraph 9.30 for the expected limits). The unsupervised access
       to the grade A and grade B areas where aseptic operations are or will be
       conducted should be restricted to appropriately qualified personnel, who have
       passed the gowning assessment and have participated in a successful APS.

7.5    Unqualified personnel should not enter grade B cleanrooms or grade A in
       operation. If needed in exceptional cases, manufacturers should establish written
       procedures outlining the process by which unqualified personnel are brought into
       the grade B and A areas. An authorized person from the manufacturer should
       supervise the unqualified personnel during their activities and should assess the
       impact of these activities on the cleanliness of the area. Access by these persons
       should be assessed and recorded in accordance with the PQS.

7.6    There should be systems in place for the disqualification of personnel from
       working in or given unsupervised entry into cleanrooms that is based on aspects
       including ongoing assessment and/or identification of an adverse trend from the
       personnel monitoring programme and/or after being implicated in a failed APS.
       Once disqualified, retraining and requalification should be completed before
       permitting the operator to have any further involvement in aseptic practices. For
       operators entering grade B cleanrooms or performing intervention into grade A,
       this requalification should include consideration of participation in a successful
       APS.

7.7    High standards of personal hygiene and cleanliness are essential to prevent
       excessive shedding or increased risk of introduction of microbial contamination.
       Personnel involved in the manufacture of sterile products should be instructed to
       report any specific health conditions or ailments which may cause the shedding
       of abnormal numbers or types of contaminants and therefore preclude cleanroom
       access. Health conditions and actions to be taken with regard to personnel who
       could be introducing an undue microbial hazard should be provided by the
       designated competent person and described in procedures.

7.8    Personnel who have been engaged in the processing of human or animal tissue
       materials or of cultures of micro-organisms, other than those used in the current
       manufacturing process, or any activities that may have a negative impact to
       quality (e.g. microbial contamination), should not enter clean areas unless clearly
       defined and effective decontamination and entry procedures have been followed
       and documented.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -21-                             25 August 2023
                                        Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products




7.9         Wristwatches, make-up, jewellery, other personal items such as mobile phones
            and any other non-essential items should not be allowed in clean areas.
            Electronic devices used in cleanrooms, e.g. mobile phones and tablets, that are
            supplied by the manufacturer solely for use in the cleanrooms, may be acceptable
            if suitably designed to permit cleaning and disinfection commensurate with the
            grade in which they are used. The use and disinfection of such equipment should
            be included in the CCS.

7.10        Cleanroom gowning and hand washing should follow a written procedure
            designed to minimize contamination of cleanroom clothing and/or the transfer of
            contaminants to the clean areas.

7.11        The clothing and its quality should be appropriate for the process and the
            grade of the working area. It should be worn in such a way as to protect the
            product from contamination. When the type of clothing chosen needs to provide
            the operator protection from the product, it should not compromise the protection
            of the product from contamination. Garments should be visually checked for
            cleanliness and integrity immediately prior to and after gowning. Gown integrity
            should also be checked upon exit. For sterilised garments and eye coverings,
            particular attention should be taken to ensure they have been subject to the
            sterilisation process, are within their specified hold time and that the packaging
            is visually inspected to ensure it is integral before use. Reusable garments
            (including eye coverings) should be replaced if damage is identified, or at a set
            frequency that is determined during qualification studies. The qualification of
            garments should consider any necessary garment testing requirements,
            including damage to garments that may not be identified by visual inspection
            alone.

7.12        Clothing should be chosen to limit shedding due to operators’ movement.

7.13        A description of typical clothing required for each cleanliness grade is given
            below:

       i.    Grade B (including access / interventions into grade A): appropriate garments
             that are dedicated for use under a sterilised suit should be worn before gowning
             (see paragraph 7.14). Appropriately sterilised, non-powdered, rubber or plastic
             gloves should be worn while donning the sterilised garments. Sterile headgear
             should enclose all hair (including facial hair) and where separate from the rest
             of the gown, it should be tucked into the neck of the sterile suit. A sterile
             facemask and sterile eye coverings (e.g. goggles) should be worn to cover and
             enclose all facial skin and prevent the shedding of droplets and particles.
             Appropriate sterilised footwear (e.g. over-boots) should be worn. Trouser legs
             should be tucked inside the footwear. Garment sleeves should be tucked into a
             second pair of sterile gloves worn over the pair worn while donning the gown.
             The protective clothing should minimize shedding of fibres or particles and
             retain particles shed by the body. The particle shedding and the particle
             retention efficiencies of the garments should be assessed during the garment
             qualification. Garments should be packed and folded in such a way as to allow
             operators to don the gown without contacting the outer surface of the garment
             and to prevent the garment from touching the floor.
      ii.    Grade C: Hair, beards and moustaches should be covered. A single or two-



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                           -22-                            25 August 2023
                                       Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



           piece trouser suit gathered at the wrists and with high neck and appropriately
           disinfected shoes or overshoes should be worn. They should minimize the
           shedding of fibres and particles.
   iii.    Grade D: Hair, beards and moustaches should be covered. A general protective
           suit and appropriately disinfected shoes or overshoes should be worn.
           Appropriate measures should be taken to avoid any ingress of contaminants
           from outside the clean area.
   iv.     Additional gowning including gloves and facemask may be required in grade C
           and D areas when performing activities considered to be a contamination risk
           as defined by the CCS.

7.14      Cleanroom gowning should be performed in change rooms of an appropriate
          cleanliness grade to ensure gown cleanliness is maintained. Outdoor clothing
          including socks (other than personal underwear) should not be brought into
          changing rooms leading directly to grade B and C areas. Single or two-piece
          facility trouser suits, covering the full length of the arms and the legs, and facility
          socks covering the feet, should be worn before entry to change rooms for grades
          B and C. Facility suits and socks should not present a risk of contamination to the
          gowning area or processes.

7.15      Every operator entering grade B or A areas should gown into clean, sterilised
          protective garments (including eye coverings and masks) of an appropriate size
          at each entry. The maximum period for which the sterilised gown may be worn
          before replacement during a shift should be defined as part of the garment
          qualification.

7.16      Gloves should be regularly disinfected during operations. Garments and gloves
          should be changed immediately if they become damaged and present any risk of
          product contamination.

7.17      Reusable clean area clothing should be cleaned in a laundry facility adequately
          segregated from production operations, using a qualified process ensuring that
          the clothing is not damaged and/or contaminated by fibres or particles during the
          repeated laundry process. Laundry facilities used should not introduce risk of
          contamination or cross-contamination. Inappropriate handling and use of clothing
          may damage fibres and increase the risk of shedding of particles. After washing
          and before packing, garments should be visually inspected for damage and visual
          cleanliness. The garment management processes should be evaluated and
          determined as part of the garment qualification programme and should include a
          maximum number of laundry and sterilisation cycles.

7.18      Activities in clean areas that are not critical to the production processes should
          be kept to a minimum, especially when aseptic operations are in progress.
          Movement of personnel should be slow, controlled and methodical to avoid
          excessive shedding of particles and organisms due to over-vigorous activity.
          Operators performing aseptic operations should adhere to aseptic technique at
          all times to prevent changes in air currents that may introduce air of lower quality
          into the critical zone. Movement adjacent to the critical zone should be restricted
          and the obstruction of the path of the unidirectional (first air) airflow should be
          avoided. A review of airflow visualisation studies should be considered as part of
          the training programme.

8      Production and Specific Technologies
TERMINALLY STERILISED PRODUCTS

8.1    Preparation of components and materials should be performed in at least a
       grade D cleanroom in order to limit the risk of microbial, endotoxin/pyrogen and
       particle contamination, so that the product is suitable for sterilisation. Where the
       product is at a high or unusual risk of microbial contamination (e.g. the product
       actively supports microbial growth, the product must be held for long periods
       before filling or the product is not processed mostly in closed vessels), then
       preparation should be carried out in at least a grade C environment. Preparation
       of ointments, creams, suspensions and emulsions should be carried out in at
       least a grade C environment before terminal sterilisation. Specific guidance
       regarding terminally sterilised veterinary medicinal products can be found within
       Annex 4 of the GMP Guide.

8.2    Primary packaging containers and components should be cleaned using
       validated processes to ensure that particle, endotoxin/pyrogen and bioburden
       contamination is appropriately controlled.

8.3    Filling of products for terminal sterilisation should be carried out in at least a
       grade C environment.

8.4    Where the CCS identifies that the product is at an unusual risk of contamination
       from the environment because, for example, the filling operation is slow, the
       containers are wide necked or are necessarily exposed for more than a few seconds
       before closing, then the product should be filled in grade A with at least a grade C
       background.

8.5    Processing of the bulk solution should include a filtration step with a
       microorganism retaining filter, where possible, to reduce bioburden levels and
       particles prior to filling into the final product containers and there should be a
       maximum permissible time between preparation and filling.

8.6    Examples of operations to be carried out in the various grades are given in
       Table 3.

Table 3: Examples of operations and grades for terminally sterilised preparation and
       processing operations

      Grade A    -     Filling of products, when unusually at risk.
      Grade C    -     Preparation of solutions, when unusually at risk.
                 -     Filling of products.
      Grade D    -     Preparation of solutions and components for subsequent filling.


ASEPTIC PREPARATION AND PROCESSING

8.7    The aseptic process should be clearly defined. The risks associated with the
       aseptic process, and any associated requirements, should be identified,
       assessed and appropriately controlled. The site’s CCS should clearly define the


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -24-                             25 August 2023
                                      Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       acceptance criteria for these controls, requirements for monitoring and the review
       of their effectiveness. Methods and procedures to control these risks should be
       described and implemented. Accepted residual risks should be formally
       documented.

8.8    Precautions to minimize microbial, endotoxin/pyrogenic and particle
       contamination should be taken, as per the site’s CCS, during the preparation
       of the aseptic environment, during all processing stages (including the stages
       before and after bulk product sterilisation), and until the product is sealed in its final
       container. The presence of materials liable to generate particles and fibres should
       be minimized in cleanrooms.

8.9    Where possible, the use of equipment such as RABS, isolators or other systems,
       should be considered in order to reduce the need for critical interventions into
       grade A and to minimize the risk of contamination. Robotics and automation of
       processes can also be considered to eliminate direct human critical interventions
       (e.g. dry heat tunnel, automated lyophilizer loading, sterilisation in place).

8.10   Examples of operations to be carried out in the various environmental grades are
       given in Table 4.

Table 4:   Examples of operations and grades for aseptic preparation and processing
           operations

            -   Aseptic assembly of filling equipment.
            -   Connections made under aseptic conditions (where sterilised product contact
                surfaces are exposed) that are post the final sterilising grade filter. These
                connections should be sterilised by steam-in-place whenever possible.
            -   Aseptic compounding and mixing.
            -   Replenishment of sterile bulk product, containers and closures.
 Grade A    -   Removal and cooling of unprotected (e.g. with no packaging) items from
                sterilisers.
            -   Staging and conveying of sterile primary packaging components in the aseptic
                filling line while not wrapped.
            -   Aseptic filling, sealing of containers such as ampoules, vial closure, transfer of
                open or partially stoppered vials.
            -   Loading of a lyophilizer.

            -   Background support for grade A (when not in an isolator).
 Grade B    -   Conveying or staging, while protected from the surrounding environment, of
                equipment, components and ancillary items for introduction into grade A.

 Grade C    -   Preparation of solutions to be filtered including sampling and dispensing.

            -   Cleaning of equipment.
            -   Handling of components, equipment and accessories after cleaning.
 Grade D    -   Assembly under HEPA filtered airflow of cleaned components, equipment and
                accessories prior to sterilisation.
            -   Assembly of closed and sterilised SUS using intrinsic sterile connection
                devices.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -25-                              25 August 2023
                                         Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



8.11        For sterile products where the final formulation cannot be filtered, the following
            should be considered:

       i.    all product and component contact equipment should be sterilised prior to use,

   ii.       all raw materials or intermediates should be sterilised and aseptically added,

   iii.      bulk solutions or intermediates should be sterilised.

8.12        The unwrapping, assembly and preparation of sterilised equipment, components
            and ancillary items with direct or indirect product contact should be treated as an
            aseptic process and performed in grade A with a grade B background. The filling
            line set-up and filling of the sterile product should be treated as an aseptic process
            and performed in grade A with a grade B background. Where an isolator is used,
            the background should be in accordance with paragraph 4.20.

8.13        Preparation and filling of sterile products such as ointments, creams,
            suspensions and emulsions should be performed in grade A with a grade B
            background when the product and components are exposed to the environment
            and the product is not subsequently filtered (via a sterilising grade filter) or
            terminally sterilised. Where an isolator or RABS is used, the background should
            be in accordance with paragraph 4.20.

8.14        Aseptic connections should be performed in grade A with a grade B background
            unless subsequently sterilised in place or conducted with intrinsic sterile
            connection devices that minimize any potential contamination from the immediate
            environment. Intrinsic sterile connection devices should be designed to mitigate
            risk of contamination.

            Where an isolator is used, the background should be in accordance with
            paragraph 4.20. Aseptic connections should be appropriately assessed and their
            effectiveness verified. For requirements regarding intrinsic sterile connection
            devices, see paragraphs 8.129 and 8.130.

8.15        Aseptic manipulations (including non-intrinsic sterile connection devices) should
            be minimized through the use of engineering design solutions such as
            preassembled and sterilised equipment. Whenever feasible, product contact
            piping and equipment should be pre-assembled, and sterilised in place.

8.16        There should be an authorized list of allowed and qualified interventions, both
            inherent and corrective, that may occur during production (see paragraph 9.34).
            Interventions should be carefully designed to ensure that the risk of
            contamination of the environment, process and product is effectively minimized.
            The process of designing interventions should include the consideration of any
            impact on air-flows and critical surfaces and products. Engineering solutions
            should be used whenever possible to minimize incursion by operators during the
            intervention. Aseptic technique should be observed at all times, including the
            appropriate use of sterile tools for manipulations. The procedures listing the types
            of inherent and corrective interventions, and how to perform them, should be first
            evaluated via risk management and APS and be kept up to date. Non-qualified
            interventions should only be used in exceptional circumstances, with due
            consideration of the risks associated with the intervention and with the
            authorisation of the quality unit. The details of the intervention conducted should


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                             -26-                            25 August 2023
                                          Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



            be subject to risk assessment, recorded and fully investigated under the
            manufacturer's PQS. Any non-qualified interventions should be thoroughly
            assessed by the quality department and considered during batch disposition.

8.17        Interventions and stoppages should be recorded in the batch record. Each line
            stoppage or intervention should be sufficiently documented in batch records with
            the associated time, duration of the event, and operators involved (ref to
            paragraph 9.34).

8.18        The duration of each aspect of aseptic preparation and processing should be
            minimized and limited to a defined and validated maximum time, including:

       i.    the holding time between equipment, component, and container cleaning,
             drying and sterilisation;

   ii.       the holding time for sterilised equipment, components, and containers before
             use and during filling/assembly;

   iii.      the holding time for a decontaminated environment, such as the RABS or
             isolator before use;

   iv.       the time between the start of the preparation of a product and its sterilisation or
             filtration through a microorganism-retaining filter (if applicable), through to the
             end of the aseptic filling process There should be a maximum permissible time
             for each product that takes into account its composition and the prescribed
             method of storage;

   v.        the holding time for sterilised product prior to filling;

   vi.       the aseptic processing time;

  vii.       the filling time.

8.19        Aseptic operations (including APS) should be observed on a regular basis by
            personnel with specific expertise in aseptic processing to verify the correct
            performance of operations including operator behaviour in the cleanroom and
            address inappropriate practices if detected.


FINISHING OF STERILE PRODUCTS

8.20        Open primary packaging containers should be maintained under grade A
            conditions with the appropriate background for the technology as described in
            paragraph 4.20. For partially stoppered vials or prefilled syringes (see paragraph
            8.126).

8.21        Final containers should be closed by appropriately validated methods.

8.22        Where final containers are closed by fusion, e.g. Blow-Fill-Seal (BFS), Form-Fill-
            Seal (FFS), Small and Large Volume Parenteral (SVP & LVP) bags, glass or
            plastic ampoules, the critical parameters and variables that affect seal integrity
            should be evaluated, determined, effectively controlled and monitored during
            operations. Glass ampoules, BFS units and small volume containers (≤100 ml)


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                              -27-                            25 August 2023
                                   Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       closed by fusion should be subject to 100% integrity testing using validated
       methods. For large volume containers (>100 ml) closed by fusion, reduced
       sampling may be acceptable where scientifically justified and based on data
       demonstrating the consistency of the existing process, and a high level of process
       control. It should be noted that visual inspection is not considered as an
       acceptable integrity test method.

8.23   Samples of products using systems other than fusion should be taken and
       checked for integrity using validated methods. The frequency of testing should
       be based on the knowledge and experience of the container and closure systems
       being used. A scientifically justified sampling plan should be used. The sample
       size should be based on information such as supplier management, packaging
       component specifications and process knowledge.

8.24   Containers sealed under vacuum should be tested for maintenance of vacuum
       after an appropriate pre-determined period prior to certification/release and during
       shelf life.

8.25   The container closure integrity validation should take into consideration any
       transportation or shipping requirements that may negatively impact the integrity
       of the container (e.g. by decompression or extreme temperatures).

8.26   Where the equipment used to crimp vial caps can generate large quantities of
       non-viable particle, measures to prevent particle contamination such as locating
       the equipment at a physically separate station equipped with adequate air
       extraction should be taken.

8.27   Vial capping of aseptically filled products can be undertaken as an aseptic
       process using sterilised caps or as a clean process outside the aseptic
       processing area. Where the latter approach is adopted, vials should be
       protected by grade A conditions up to the point of leaving the aseptic processing
       area, and thereafter stoppered vials should be protected with a grade A air supply
       until the cap has been crimped. The supporting background environment of grade
       A air supply should meet at least grade D requirements. Where capping is a
       manual process, it should be performed under grade A conditions either in an
       appropriately designed isolator or in grade A with a grade B background.

8.28   Where capping of aseptically filled sterile product is conducted as a clean process
       with grade A air supply protection, vials with missing or displaced stoppers
       should be rejected prior to capping. Appropriately qualified, automated methods
       for stopper height detection should be in place.

8.29   Where human intervention is required at the capping station, appropriate
       technological and organizational measures should be used to prevent direct
       contact with the vials and to minimize contamination. RABS and isolators may be
       beneficial in assuring the required conditions.

8.30   All filled containers of parenteral products should be inspected individually for
       extraneous contamination or other defects. Defect classification and criticality
       should be determined during qualification and based on risk and historical
       knowledge. Factors to consider include, but are not limited to, the potential impact
       of the defect to the patient and the route of administration. Different defect types
       should be categorized and batch performance analysed. Batches with unusual


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -28-                            25 August 2023
                                    Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       levels of defects, when compared with routine defect numbers for the process
       (based on routine and trend data), should be investigated. A defect library should
       be generated and maintained which captures all known classes of defects. The
       defect library should be used for the training of production and quality assurance
       personnel. Critical defects should not be identified during any subsequent
       sampling and inspection of acceptable containers. Any critical defect identified
       subsequently should trigger an investigation as it indicates a possible failure of
       the original inspection process.

8.31   When inspection is performed manually, it should be conducted under suitable
       and controlled conditions of illumination and background. Inspection rates should
       be appropriately controlled and qualified. Operators performing the inspection
       should undergo visual inspection qualification (whilst wearing corrective lenses, if
       these are normally worn) at least annually. The qualification should be
       undertaken using appropriate samples from the manufacturer's defect library sets
       and taking into consideration worst case scenarios (e.g. inspection time, line
       speed where the product is transferred to the operator by a conveyor system,
       container size or fatigue) and should include consideration of eyesight checks.
       Operator distractions should be minimized and frequent breaks, of an appropriate
       duration, should be taken from inspection.

8.32   Where automated methods of inspection are used, the process should be
       validated to detect known defects (which may impact product quality or safety)
       and be equal to, or better than, manual inspection methods. The performance of
       the equipment should be challenged using representative defects prior to start up
       and at regular intervals throughout the batch.

8.33   Results of the inspection should be recorded and defect types and numbers
       trended. Reject levels for the various defect types should also be trended based
       on statistical principles. Impact to product on the market should be assessed as
       part of the investigation when adverse trends are observed.


STERILISATION

8.34   Where possible, finished product should be terminally sterilised, using a validated
       and controlled sterilisation process, as this provides a greater assurance of
       sterility than a validated and controlled sterile filtration process and/or aseptic
       processing. Where it is not possible for a product to undergo terminal sterilisation,
       consideration should be given to using post-aseptic processing terminal heat
       treatment, combined with aseptic process to give improved sterility assurance.

8.35   The selection, design and location of the equipment and cycle/programme used
       for sterilisation should be based on scientific principles and data which
       demonstrate repeatability and reliability of the sterilisation process. All
       parameters should be defined, and where critical, these should be controlled,
       monitored and recorded.

8.36   All sterilisation processes should be validated. Validation studies should take into
       account the product composition, storage conditions and maximum time between
       the start of the preparation of a product or material to be sterilised and its
       sterilisation. Before any sterilisation process is adopted, its suitability for the
       product and equipment, and its efficacy in consistently achieving the desired


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -29-                            25 August 2023
                                    Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       sterilising conditions in all parts of each type of load to be processed should be
       validated notably by physical measurements and where appropriate by Biological
       Indicators (BI). For effective sterilisation, the whole of the product, and surfaces
       of equipment and components should be subject to the required treatment and
       the process should be designed to ensure that this is achieved.

8.37   Particular attention should be given when the adopted product sterilisation
       method is not described in the current edition of the Pharmacopoeia, or when it
       is used for a product which is not a simple aqueous solution. Where possible,
       heat sterilisation is the method of choice.

8.38   Validated loading patterns should be established for all sterilisation processes
       and load patterns should be subject to periodic revalidation. Maximum and
       minimum loads should also be considered as part of the overall load validation
       strategy.

8.39   The validity of the sterilizing process should be reviewed and verified at
       scheduled intervals based on risk. Heat sterilization cycles should be revalidated
       with a minimum frequency of at least annually for load patterns that are
       considered worst case. Other load patterns should be validated at a frequency
       justified in the CCS.

8.40   Routine operating parameters should be established and adhered to for all
       sterilisation processes, e.g. physical parameters and loading patterns.

8.41   There should be mechanisms in place to detect a sterilisation cycle that does not
       conform to the validated parameters. Any failed sterilisation or sterilisation that
       deviated from the validated process (e.g. have longer or shorter phases such as
       heating cycles) should be investigated.

8.42   Suitable BIs placed at appropriate locations should be considered as an
       additional method to support the validation of the sterilisation process. BIs should
       be stored and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Where BIs are
       used to support validation and/or to monitor a sterilisation process (e.g. with
       ethylene oxide), positive controls should be tested for each sterilisation cycle. If
       BIs are used, strict precautions should be taken to avoid transferring microbial
       contamination to the manufacturing or other testing processes. BI results in
       isolation should not be used to override other critical parameters and process
       design elements.

8.43   The reliability of BIs is important. Suppliers should be qualified and transportation
       and storage conditions should be controlled in order that BI quality is not
       compromised. Prior to use of a new batch/lot of BIs, the population, purity and
       identity of the indicator organism of the batch/lot should be verified. For other
       critical parameters, e.g. D-value, Z-value, the batch certificate provided by the
       qualified supplier can normally be used.

8.44   There should be a clear means of differentiating products, equipment and
       components, which have not been subjected to the sterilisation process from
       those which have. Equipment such as baskets or trays used to carry products,
       other items of equipment and/or components should be clearly labelled (or
       electronically tracked) with the product name and batch number and an indication
       of whether or not it has been sterilised. Indicators such as autoclave tape, or


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -30-                            25 August 2023
                                    Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       irradiation indicators may be used, where appropriate, to indicate whether or not
       a batch (or sub-batch material, component, equipment) has passed through a
       sterilisation process. However, these indicators show only that the sterilisation
       process has occurred; they do not indicate product sterility or achievement of the
       required sterility assurance level.

8.45   Sterilisation records should be available for each sterilisation run. Each cycle
       should have a unique identifier. Their conformity should be reviewed and
       approved as part of the batch certification/release procedure.

8.46   Where required, materials, equipment and components should be sterilised by
       validated methods appropriate to the specific material. Suitable protection after
       sterilisation should be provided to prevent recontamination. If sterilised items are
       not used immediately after sterilisation, these should be stored using
       appropriately sealed packaging and a maximum hold time should be established.
       Where justified, components that have been packaged with multiple sterile
       packaging layers need not be stored in a cleanroom if the integrity and
       configuration of the sterile pack allows the items to be readily disinfected during
       transfer by operators into grade A (e.g. by the use of multiple sterile coverings
       that can be removed at each transfer from lower to higher grade). Where
       protection is achieved by containment in sealed packaging, this packaging
       process should be undertaken prior to sterilisation.

8.47   Where materials, equipment, components and ancillary items are sterilised in
       sealed packaging and then transferred into grade A, this should be done using
       appropriate validated methods (for example, airlocks or pass-through hatches)
       with accompanying disinfection of the exterior of the sealed packaging. The use
       of rapid transfer port technology should also be considered. These methods
       should be demonstrated to effectively control the potential risk of contamination
       of the grade A and grade B areas and, likewise, the disinfection procedure should
       be demonstrated to be effective in reducing any contamination on the packaging
       to acceptable levels for entry of the item into the grade B and grade A areas.

8.48   Where materials, equipment, components and ancillary items are sterilised in
       sealed packaging or containers, the packaging should be qualified for minimizing
       the risk of particulate, microbial, endotoxin/pyrogen or chemical contamination,
       and for compatibility with the selected sterilisation method. The packaging sealing
       process should be validated. The validation should consider the integrity of the
       sterile protective barrier system, the maximum hold time before sterilisation and
       the maximum shelf life assigned to the sterilised items. The integrity of the sterile
       protective barrier system for each of the sterilised items should be checked prior
       to use.

8.49   For materials, equipment, components and ancillary items that are not a direct or
       indirect product contact part and are necessary for aseptic processing but cannot
       be sterilised, an effective and validated disinfection and transfer process should
       be in place. These items, once disinfected, should be protected to prevent
       recontamination. These items, and others representing potential routes of
       contamination, should be included in the environmental monitoring programme.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -31-                            25 August 2023
                                   Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



STERILISATION BY HEAT

8.50   Each heat sterilisation cycle should be recorded either electronically or by
       hardcopy, using equipment with suitable accuracy and precision. The system
       should have safeguards and/or redundancy in its control and monitoring
       instrumentation to detect a cycle not conforming to the validated cycle parameter
       requirements and abort or fail this cycle (e.g. by the use of duplex/double probes
       connected to independent control and monitoring systems).

8.51   The position of the temperature probes used for controlling and/or recording
       should be determined during the validation and selected based on system design
       and in order to correctly record and represent routine cycle conditions. Validation
       studies should be designed to demonstrate the suitability of system control and
       recording probe locations, and should include the verification of the function and
       location of these probes by the use of an independent monitoring probe located
       at the same position during validation.

8.52   The whole of the load should reach the required temperature before
       measurement of the sterilising time-period starts. For sterilisation cycles
       controlled by using a reference probe within the load, specific consideration
       should be given to ensuring the load probe temperature is controlled within
       defined temperature range prior to cycle commencement.

8.53   After completion of the high temperature phase of a heat sterilisation cycle,
       precautions should be taken against contamination of a sterilised load during
       cooling. Any cooling liquid or gas that comes into contact with the product or
       sterilised material should be sterilised.

8.54   In those cases where parametric release has been authorized, a robust system
       should be applied to the product lifecycle validation and the routine monitoring of
       the manufacturing process. This system should be periodically reviewed. Further
       guidance regarding parametric release is provided in Annex 17.


MOIST HEAT STERILISATION

8.55   Moist heat sterilisation can be achieved using steam, (direct or indirect contact),
       but also includes other systems such as superheated water systems (cascade or
       immersion cycles) that could be used for containers that may be damaged by
       other cycle designs (e.g. Blow-Fill-Seal containers, plastic bags).

8.56   The items to be sterilised, other than products in sealed containers, should be dry,
       packaged in a protective barrier system which allows removal of air and
       penetration of steam and prevents recontamination after sterilisation. All loaded
       items should be dry upon removal from the steriliser. Load dryness should be
       confirmed by visual inspection as a part of the sterilisation process acceptance.

8.57   For porous cycles (hard goods), time, temperature and pressure should be used
       to monitor the process and be recorded. Each sterilised item should be inspected
       for damage, packaging material integrity and moisture on removal from the
       autoclave. Any item found not to be fit for purpose should be removed from the
       manufacturing area and an investigation performed.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -32-                            25 August 2023
                                   Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



8.58   For autoclaves capable of performing prevacuum sterilisation cycles, the
       temperature should be recorded at the chamber drain throughout the sterilisation
       period. Load probes may also be used where appropriate but the controlling
       system should remain related to the load validation. For steam in place systems,
       the temperature should be recorded at appropriate condensate drain locations
       throughout the sterilisation period.

8.59   Validation of porous cycles should include a calculation of equilibration time,
       exposure time, correlation of pressure and temperature and the
       minimum/maximum temperature range during exposure. Validation of fluid cycles
       should include temperature, time and/or F0. Critical processing parameters
       should be subject to defined limits (including appropriate tolerances) and be
       confirmed as part of the sterilisation validation and routine cycle acceptance
       criteria.

8.60   Leak tests on the steriliser should be carried out periodically (normally weekly)
       when a vacuum phase is part of the cycle or the system is returned, post-
       sterilisation, to a pressure lower than the environment surrounding the steriliser.

8.61   There should be adequate assurance of air removal prior to and during
       sterilisation when the sterilisation process includes air purging (e.g. porous
       autoclave loads, lyophilizer chambers). For autoclaves, this should include an air
       removal test cycle (normally performed on a daily basis) or the use of an air
       detector system. Loads to be sterilised should be designed to support effective
       air removal and be free draining to prevent the build-up of condensate.

8.62   Distortion and damage of non-rigid containers that are terminally sterilised, such
       as containers produced by Blow-Fill-Seal or Form-Fill-Seal technologies, should
       be prevented by appropriate cycle design and control (for instance setting correct
       pressure, heating and cooling rates and loading patterns).

8.63   Where steam in place systems are used for sterilisation (e.g. for fixed pipework,
       vessels and lyophilizer chambers), the system should be appropriately designed
       and validated to assure all parts of the system are subjected to the required
       treatment. The system should be monitored for temperature, pressure and time
       at appropriate locations during routine use to ensure all areas are effectively and
       reproducibly sterilised. These locations should be demonstrated as being
       representative of, and correlated with, the slowest to heat locations during initial
       and routine validation. Once a system has been sterilised by steam in place, it
       should remain integral and where operations require, maintained under positive
       pressure or otherwise equipped with a sterilising vent filter prior to use.

8.64   In fluids load cycles where superheated water is used as the heat transfer
       medium, the heated water should consistently reach all of the required contact
       points. Initial qualification studies should include temperature mapping of the
       entire load. There should be routine checks on the equipment to ensure that
       nozzles (where the water is introduced) are not blocked and drains remain free
       from debris.

8.65   Validation of the sterilisation of fluids loads in a superheated water autoclave
       should include temperature mapping of the entire load and heat penetration and
       reproducibility studies. All parts of the load should heat up uniformly and achieve
       the desired temperature for the specified time. Routine temperature monitoring


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -33-                            25 August 2023
                                         Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



            probes should be correlated to the worst case positions identified during the
            qualification process.


DRY HEAT STERILISATION

8.66        Dry heat sterilisation utilizes high temperatures of air or gas to sterilise a product
            or article. Dry heat sterilisation is of particular use in the thermal removal of
            difficult-to-eliminate thermally robust contaminants such as endotoxin/pyrogen
            and is often used in the preparation of components for aseptic filling. The
            combination of time and temperature to which product, components or equipment
            are exposed should produce an adequate and reproducible level of lethality
            and/or endotoxin/pyrogen inactivation/removal when operated routinely within
            the established limits. The process may be operated in an oven or in a continuous
            tunnel process, e.g. for sterilisation and depyrogenation of glass containers.

8.67        Dry heat sterilisation/depyrogenation tunnels should be configured to ensure that
            airflow protects the integrity and performance of the grade A sterilising zone by
            maintaining appropriate pressure differentials and airflow through the tunnel. Air
            pressure difference profiles should be assessed. The impact of any airflow
            change should be assessed to ensure the heating profile is maintained. All air
            supplied to the tunnel should pass through at least a HEPA filter and periodic
            tests (at least biannually) should be performed to demonstrate air filter integrity.
            Any tunnel parts that come into contact with sterilised components should be
            appropriately sterilised or disinfected. Critical process parameters that should be
            considered during validation and/or routine processing should include, but are
            not limited to:

       i.    belt speed or dwell time within the sterilising zone,

   ii.       temperature – minimum and maximum temperatures,

   iii.      heat penetration of the material/article,

   iv.       heat distribution/uniformity,

   v.        airflows determined by air pressure difference profiles correlated with the heat
             distribution and penetration studies.

8.68        When a thermal process is used as part of the depyrogenation process for any
            component or product contact equipment/material, validation studies should be
            performed to demonstrate that the process provides a suitable Fh value and
            results in a minimum 3 log10 reduction in endotoxin concentration. When this is
            attained, there is no additional requirement to demonstrate sterilisation in these
            cases.

8.69        Containers spiked with endotoxin should be used during validation and should be
            carefully managed with a full reconciliation performed. Containers should be
            representative of the materials normally processed (in respect to composition of
            the packaging materials, porosity, dimensions, nominal volume). Endotoxin
            quantification and recovery efficiency should also be demonstrated.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                             -34-                            25 August 2023
                                            Annex 1      Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



8.70        Dry heat ovens are typically employed to sterilise or depyrogenate primary
            packaging components, starting materials or active substances but may be used
            for other processes. They should be maintained at a positive pressure relative to
            lower grade clean areas throughout the sterilisation and post sterilisation hold
            process unless the integrity of the packaging is maintained. All air entering the
            oven should pass through a HEPA filter. Critical process parameters that should
            be considered in qualification and/or routine processing should include, but are
            not limited to:

       i.    temperature,

    ii.      exposure period/time,

   iii.      chamber pressure (for maintenance of over pressure),

   iv.       air speed,

    v.       air quality within the oven,

   vi.       heat penetration of material/article (slow to heat spots),

  vii.       heat distribution/uniformity,

  viii.      load pattern and configuration of articles to be sterilised/depyrogenated
             including minimum and maximum loads.


STERILISATION BY RADIATION

8.71        Sterilisation by radiation is used mainly for the sterilisation of heat sensitive
            materials and products. Ultraviolet irradiation is not an acceptable method of
            sterilisation. Guidance regarding ionising radiation sterilisation can be found
            within Annex 12.

8.72        Validation procedures should ensure that the effects of variation in density of the
            product and packages are considered.


STERILISATION WITH ETHYLENE OXIDE

8.73        This method should only be used when no other method is practicable. During
            process validation, it should be shown that there is no damaging effect on the
            product and that the conditions and time allowed for degassing result in the
            reduction of any residual ethylene oxide (EO) gas and reaction products to
            defined acceptable limits for the given product or material.

8.74        Direct contact between gas and microbial cells is essential, precautions should
            be taken to avoid the presence of organisms likely to be enclosed in material
            such as crystals or dried protein. The nature, porosity and quantity of packaging
            materials can significantly affect the process.

8.75        Before exposure to the gas, materials should be brought into equilibrium
            with the humidity and temperature required by the process. Where steam is


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                              -35-                            25 August 2023
                                         Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



            used to condition the load for sterilisation, it should be of an appropriate quality.
            The time required for this should be balanced against the opposing need to
            minimize the time before sterilisation.

8.76        Each sterilisation cycle should be monitored with suitable BIs, using the
            appropriate number of test units distributed throughout the load at defined
            locations that have been shown to be worst case locations during validation.

8.77        Critical process parameters that could be considered as part of the sterilisation
            process validation and routine monitoring include, but are not limited to:

       i.    EO gas concentration,

   ii.       pressure,

   iii.      amount of EO gas used,

   iv.       relative humidity,

   v.        temperature,

   vi.       exposure time.

8.78        After sterilisation, the load should be aerated to allow EO gas and/or its reaction
            products to desorb from the packaged product to predetermined levels. Aeration
            can occur within a steriliser chamber and/or in a separate aeration chamber or
            aeration room. The aeration phase should be validated as part of the overall EO
            sterilisation process validation.


FILTER STERILISATION OF PRODUCTS WHICH CANNOT BE STERILISED IN
THEIR FINAL CONTAINER

8.79        If the product cannot be sterilised in its final container, solutions or liquids should
            be sterilised by filtration through a sterile sterilising grade filter (with a nominal
            pore size of a maximum of 0.22 µm that has been appropriately validated to
            obtain a sterile filtrate) and subsequently aseptically filled into a previously
            sterilised container. The selection of the filter used should ensure that it is
            compatible with the product and as described in the marketing authorization (see
            paragraph 8.135).

8.80        Suitable bioburden reduction prefilters and/or sterilising grade filters may be used
            at multiple points during the manufacturing process to ensure a low and
            controlled bioburden of the liquid prior to the final sterilising filter. Due to the
            potential additional risks of a sterile filtration process, as compared with other
            sterilisation processes, an additional filtration through a sterile sterilising grade
            filter, as close to the point of fill as possible, should be considered as part of an
            overall CCS.

8.81        The selection of components for the filtration system and their interconnection
            and arrangement within the filtration system, including pre-filters, should be
            based on the critical quality attributes of the product, justified and documented.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                             -36-                             25 August 2023
                                               Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



            The filtration system should minimize the generation of fibres and particles, not
            cause or contribute to unacceptable levels of impurities, or possess
            characteristics that otherwise alter the quality and efficacy of the product.
            Similarly, the filter characteristics should be compatible with the fluid and not be
            adversely affected by the product to be filtered. Adsorption of product
            components and extraction/leaching of filter components should be evaluated
            (see paragraph 8.135).

8.82        The filtration system should be designed to:

       i.        allow operation within validated process parameters;

   ii.           maintain the sterility of the filtrate;

   iii.          minimize the number of aseptic connections required between the final
                 sterilising grade filter and the final filling of the product;

   iv.           allow cleaning procedures to be conducted as necessary;

   v.            allow sterilisation procedures, including sterilisation in place, to be conducted
                 as necessary;

   vi.           permit in-place integrity testing, of the 0.22 µm final sterilising grade filter,
                 preferably as a closed system, both prior to, and following filtration as
                 necessary. In-place integrity testing methods should be selected to avoid any
                 adverse impact on the quality of the product.

8.83        Sterile filtration of liquids should be validated in accordance with relevant
            Pharmacopeia requirements. Validation can be grouped by different strengths or
            variations of a product but should be done under worst case conditions. The
            rationale for grouping should be justified and documented.

8.84        During filter validation, wherever possible, the product to be filtered should be
            used for bacterial retention testing of the sterilising grade filter. Where the product
            to be filtered is not suitable for use in bacterial retention testing, a suitable
            surrogate product should be justified for use in the test. The challenge organism
            used in the bacterial retention test should be justified.

8.85        Filtration parameters that should be considered and established during validation
            should include, but are not limited to:

            i.      The wetting fluid used for filter integrity testing:

                     It should be based on the filter manufacturer’s recommendation or the fluid
                      to be filtered. The appropriate integrity test value specification should be
                      established.
                     If the system is flushed or integrity tested in-situ with a fluid other than the
                      product, appropriate actions are taken to avoid any deleterious effect on
                      product quality.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                                   -37-                            25 August 2023
                                        Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       ii.   Filtration process conditions including:

              fluid pre-filtration holding time and effect on bioburden,

              filter conditioning, with fluid if necessary,

              maximum filtration time/total time filter is in contact with the fluid,

              maximum operating pressure,

              flow rate,

              maximum filtration volume,

              temperature,

              the time taken to filter a known volume of bulk solution and the pressure
               difference to be used across the filter.

8.86   Routine process controls should be implemented to ensure adherence to
       validated filtration parameters. Results of critical process parameters should be
       included in the batch record, including but not limited to the minimum time taken
       to filter a known volume of bulk solution and pressure difference across the filter.
       Any significant difference from critical parameters during manufacturing should
       be documented and investigated.

8.87   The integrity of the sterilised filter assembly should be verified by integrity testing
       before use (pre-use post sterilisation integrity test or PUPSIT), to check for
       damage and loss of integrity caused by the filter preparation prior to use. A
       sterilising grade filter that is used to sterilise a fluid should be subject to a non-
       destructive integrity test post-use prior to removal of the filter from its housing.
       The integrity test process should be validated and test results should correlate to
       the microbial retention capability of the filter established during validation.
       Examples of tests that are used include bubble point, diffusive flow, water
       intrusion or pressure hold test. It is recognized that PUPSIT may not always be
       possible after sterilisation due to process constraints (e.g. the filtration of very
       small volumes of solution). In these cases, an alternative approach may be taken
       providing that a thorough risk assessment has been performed and compliance
       is achieved by the implementation of appropriate controls to mitigate any risk of
       a non-integral filtration system. Points to consider in such a risk assessment
       should include but are not limited to:

       i.    in depth knowledge and control of the filter sterilisation process to ensure
             that the potential for damage to the filter is minimized,

       ii.   in depth knowledge and control of the supply chain to include:

                contract sterilisation facilities,
                defined transport mechanisms,
                packaging of the sterilised filter, to prevent damage to the filter during
                 transportation and storage.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                            -38-                            25 August 2023
                                        Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products




       iii.   in depth process knowledge such as:

                 the specific product type, including particle burden and whether there
                  exists any risk of impact on filter integrity values, such as the potential to
                  alter integrity-testing values and therefore prevent the detection of a non-
                  integral filter during a post-use filter integrity test; and
                 pre-filtration and processing steps, prior to the final sterilising grade filter,
                  which would remove particle burden and clarify the product prior to the
                  sterile filtration.

8.88    The integrity of critical sterile gas and air vent filters (that are directly linked to the
        sterility of the product) should be verified by testing after use, with the filter
        remaining in the filter assembly or housing.

8.89    The integrity of non-critical air or gas vent filters should be confirmed and
        recorded at appropriate intervals. Where gas filters are in place for extended
        periods, integrity testing should be carried out at installation and prior to
        replacement. The maximum duration of use should be specified and monitored
        based on risk (e.g. considering the maximum number of uses and heat treatment/
        sterilisation cycles permitted as applicable).

8.90    For gas filtration, unintended moistening or wetting of the filter or filter equipment
        should be avoided.

8.91    If the sterilising filtration process has been validated as a system consisting of
        multiple filters to achieve the sterility for a given fluid, the filtration system is
        considered to be a single sterilising unit and all filters within the system should
        satisfactorily pass integrity testing after use.

8.92    In a redundant filtration system (where a second redundant sterilising grade filter
        is present as a backup but the sterilising process is validated as only requiring
        one filter), post-use integrity test of the primary sterilising grade filter should be
        performed and if demonstrated to be integral, then a post-use integrity test of the
        redundant (backup) filter is not necessary. However, in the event of a failure of
        the post-use integrity test on the primary filter, post-use integrity test on the
        secondary (redundant) filter should be performed, in conjunction with an
        investigation and risk assessment to determine the reason for the primary filter
        test failure.

8.93    Bioburden samples should be taken from the bulk product and immediately prior
        to the final sterile filtration. In case where a redundant filtration set-up is used, it
        should be taken prior to the first filter. Systems for taking samples should be
        designed so as not to introduce contamination.

8.94    Liquid sterilising grade filters should be discarded after the processing of a single
        batch and the same filter should not be used continuously for more than one
        working day unless such use has been validated.
8.95    Where campaign manufacture of a product has been appropriately justified in the
        CCS and validated, the filter user should:




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                            -39-                             25 August 2023
                                       Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



        i.    assess and document the risks associated with the duration of filter use for
              the sterile filtration process for a given fluid;
       ii.    conduct and document effective validation and qualification studies to
              demonstrate that the duration of filter use for a given sterile filtration process
              and for a given fluid does not compromise performance of the final sterilising
              grade filter or filtrate quality;
       iii.   document the maximum validated duration of use for the filter and implement
              controls to ensure that filters are not used beyond the validated maximum
              duration. Records of these controls should be maintained;
       iv.    implement controls to ensure that filters contaminated with fluid or cleaning
              agent residues, or considered defective in any other way, are removed from
              use.


FORM-FILL-SEAL (FFS)

8.96    The conditions for FFS machines used for terminally sterilised products should
        comply with the environmental requirements of paragraphs 8.3 and 8.4 of this
        Annex. The conditions for FFS machines used in aseptic manufacture should
        comply with the environmental requirements of paragraph 8.10 of this Annex.

8.97    Contamination of the packaging films used in the FFS process should be
        minimized by appropriate controls during component fabrication, supply and
        handling. Due to the criticality of packaging films, procedures should be
        implemented to ensure that the films supplied meet defined specifications and
        are of the appropriate quality, including material thickness and strength, microbial
        and particulate contamination, integrity and artwork, as relevant. The sampling
        frequency, the bioburden and, where applicable, endotoxin/pyrogen levels of
        packaging films and associated components should be defined and controlled
        within the PQS and considered in the CCS.

8.98    Particular attention should be given to understanding and assessing the
        operation of the equipment, including set-up, filling, sealing and cutting
        processes, so that critical process parameters are understood, validated,
        controlled and monitored appropriately.

8.99    Any product contact gases, e.g. those used to inflate the container or used as a
        product overlay, should be appropriately filtered, as close to the point of use as
        possible. The quality of gases used and the effectiveness of gas filtration systems
        should be verified periodically in accordance with paragraphs 6.18 and 6.19.

8.100 The controls identified during qualification of FFS should be in alignment with the
      CCS. Aspects to be considered include but are not limited to:

        i.    determination of the boundaries of the critical zone,

       ii.    environmental control and monitoring, both of the machine and the
              background in which it is placed,

       iii.   personnel gowning requirements,




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -40-                             25 August 2023
                                      Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



      iv.    integrity testing of the product filling lines and filtration systems (as relevant),

       v.    duration of the batch or filling campaign,

      vi.    control of packaging films, including             any    requirements     for   film
             decontamination or sterilisation,

      vii.   cleaning-in-place and sterilisation-in-place of equipment as necessary,

     viii.   machine operation, settings and alarm management (as relevant).

8.101 Critical process parameters for FFS should be determined during equipment
      qualification and should include, but are not limited to:

        i.   settings for uniform package dimensions and cutting in accordance with
             validated parameters;

       ii.   setting, maintenance and monitoring of validated forming temperatures
             (including pre-heating and cooling), forming times and pressures as relevant;

      iii.   setting, maintenance and monitoring of validated sealing temperatures,
             sealing temperature uniformity across the seal, sealing times and pressures
             as relevant;

      iv.    environmental and product temperature;

       v.    batch-specific testing of package seal strength and uniformity;

      vi.    settings for correct filling volumes, speeds and uniformity;

      vii.   settings for any additional printing (batch coding), embossing or debossing
             to ensure that unit integrity is not compromised;

     viii.   methods and parameters for integrity testing of filled containers (see
             paragraph 8.22).

8.102 Appropriate procedures for the verification, monitoring and recording of FFS
      critical process parameters and equipment operation should be applied during
      production.

8.103 Operational procedures should describe how forming and sealing issues are
      detected and rectified. Rejected units or sealing issues should be recorded and
      investigated.

8.104 Appropriate maintenance procedures should be established based on risk, and
      include maintenance and inspection plans for tooling critical to the effectiveness
      of unit sealing. Any issues identified that indicate a potential product quality
      concern should be documented and investigated.

BLOW-FILL-SEAL

8.105 Blow-Fill-Seal equipment used for the manufacture of products which are
      terminally sterilised should be installed in at least a grade D environment. The
      conditions at the point of fill should comply with the environmental requirements
      of paragraphs 8.3 and 8.4.

8.106 BFS used for aseptic processing:

       i.    For shuttle type equipment used for aseptic filling, the parison is open to the
             environment and therefore the areas where parison extrusion, blow-
             moulding and sealing take place should meet grade A conditions at the
             critical zones. The filling environment should be designed and maintained to
             meet grade A conditions for viable and total particle limits both at rest and
             when in operation.

       ii.   For rotary-type equipment used for aseptic filling, the parison is generally
             closed to the environment once formed, the filling environment within the
             parison should be designed and maintained to meet grade A conditions for
             viable and total particle limits both at rest and when in operation.

      iii.   The equipment should be installed in at least a grade C environment,
             provided that grade A/B clothing is used. The microbiological monitoring of
             operators wearing grade A/B clothing in a grade C area, should be performed
             in accordance with risk management principles, and the limits and monitoring
             frequencies applied with consideration of the activities performed by these
             operators.

8.107 Due to the generation of particles from polymer extrusion and cutting during
      operation, and the restrictive size of critical filling zones of BFS equipment, in
      operation monitoring of total particle for BFS equipment is not expected.
      However, data should be available to demonstrate that the design of the
      equipment ensures that critical zones of the filling process environment would
      meet grade A conditions in operation.

8.108 Viable environmental monitoring of BFS processes should be risk-based, and
      designed in accordance with section 9 of this Annex. In operation viable
      monitoring should be undertaken for the full duration of critical processing,
      including equipment assembly. For rotary-type BFS equipment, it is
      acknowledged that monitoring of the critical filling zone may not be possible.

8.109 The environmental control and monitoring programme should take into
      consideration the moving parts and complex airflow paths generated by the BFS
      process and the effect of the high heat outputs of the process, (e.g. through the
      use of airflow visualization studies and/or other equivalent studies).
      Environmental monitoring programmes should also consider factors such as air-
      filter configuration, air-filter integrity, cooling systems integrity (see paragraph
      6.21), equipment design and qualification.

8.110 Air or other gases that make contact with critical surfaces of the container during
      extrusion, formation or sealing of the moulded container should undergo
      appropriate filtration. The quality of gas used and the effectiveness of gas



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -42-                            25 August 2023
                                      Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



        filtration systems should be verified periodically in accordance with paragraphs
        6.18 and 6.19.

8.111 Particulate and microbial contamination of the polymer granulate should be
      prevented by appropriate design, control, and maintenance of the polymer
      granulate storage, sampling and distribution systems.

8.112 The capability of the extrusion system to provide appropriate sterility assurance
      for the moulded container should be understood and validated. The sampling
      frequency, the bioburden and, where applicable, endotoxin/pyrogen levels of the
      raw polymer should be defined and controlled within the PQS and considered in
      the CCS.

8.113 Interventions requiring cessation of filling and/or extrusion, moulding and sealing
      and, where required, re-sterilisation of the filling machine should be clearly
      defined and described in the filling procedure, and included in the APS as relevant
      (see paragraphs 9.34, 9.35 and 9.36).

8.114 The controls identified during qualification of BFS should be in alignment with the
      site’s CCS. Aspects to be considered include but are not limited to:

        i.   determination of the boundaries of the critical zone,

       ii.   environmental control and monitoring, both of the machine and the
             background in which it is placed,

      iii.   personnel gowning requirements,

      iv.    integrity testing of the product filling lines and filtration systems (as relevant),

       v.    duration of the batch or filling campaign,

      vi.    control of polymer granulate, including distribution systems and critical
             extrusion temperatures,

      vii.   cleaning-in-place and sterilisation-in-place of equipment as necessary,

     viii.   machine operation, settings and alarm management (as relevant).

8.115 Critical process parameters for BFS should be determined during equipment
      qualification and should include, but are not limited to:

        i.   clean-in-place and sterilisation-in-place of product pipelines and filling
             needles (mandrels);

       ii.   setting, maintenance and monitoring of extrusion parameters, including
             temperature, speed and extruder throat settings for parison thickness;

      iii.   setting, maintenance and monitoring of mould temperatures, including rate
             of cooling where necessary for product stability;

      iv.    preparation and sterilisation of ancillary components added to the moulded
             unit, e.g. bottle caps;


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -43-                             25 August 2023
                                      Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products




       v.    environmental control, cleaning, sterilisation and monitoring of the critical
             extrusion, transfer and filling areas as relevant;

      vi.    batch-specific testing of package wall-thickness at critical points of the
             container;

     vii.    settings for correct filling volumes, speeds and uniformity;

     viii.   settings for any additional printing (batch coding), embossing or debossing
             to ensure that unit integrity and quality is not compromised;

      ix.    methods and parameters for integrity testing of 100% of all filled containers
             (see paragraph 8.22);

       x.    settings for cutters or punches used to remove waste plastic surrounding
             filled units (flash removal).

8.116 Appropriate procedures for the verification, monitoring and recording of BFS
      critical process parameters and equipment operation should be applied during
      production.

8.117 Operational procedures should describe how blowing, forming and sealing issues
      are detected and rectified. Rejected units or sealing issues should be recorded
      and investigated.

8.118 Where the BFS process includes the addition of components to moulded
      containers (e.g. addition of caps to LVP bottles), these components should be
      appropriately decontaminated and added to the process using a clean, controlled
      process.

        i.   For aseptic processes, the addition of components should be performed
             under grade A conditions, to ensure the sterility of critical surfaces, using pre-
             sterilised components.

       ii.   For terminally sterilised products, the validation of terminal sterilisation
             processes should ensure the sterility of all critical product pathways between
             the component and moulded container, including areas that are not wetted
             during sterilisation.

      iii.   Testing procedures should be established and validated to ensure the
             effective sealing of components and moulded containers.

8.119 Appropriate maintenance procedures should be established based on risk, and
      include maintenance and inspection plans for items critical to unit sealing,
      integrity and sterility.

8.120 The moulds used to form containers are considered critical equipment and any
      changes or modification to moulds should result in an assessment of finished
      product container integrity, and where the assessment indicates, should be
      supported by validation. Any issues identified that indicate a potential product
      quality concern should be documented and investigated.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -44-                             25 August 2023
                                        Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products




LYOPHILIZATION

8.121 Lyophilization is a critical process step and all activities that can affect the sterility
      of the product or material need to be regarded as extensions of the aseptic
      processing of the sterilised product. The lyophilization equipment and its
      processes should be designed to ensure that product or material sterility is
      maintained during lyophilization by preventing microbial and particle
      contamination between the filling of products for lyophilization, and completion of
      lyophilization process. All control measures in place should be determined by the
      site’s CCS.

8.122 The sterilisation of the lyophilizer and associated equipment (e.g. trays, vial
      support rings) should be validated and the holding time between the sterilisation
      cycle and use appropriately challenged during APS (see paragraph 9.33). The
      lyophilizer should be sterilised regularly, based on system design. Re-sterilisation
      should be performed following maintenance or cleaning. Sterilised lyophilizers
      and associated equipment should be protected from contamination after
      sterilisation.

8.123 Lyophilizers and associated product transfer and loading/unloading areas should
      be designed to minimize operator intervention as far as possible. The frequency
      of lyophilizer sterilisation should be determined based on the design and risks
      related to system contamination during use. Lyophilizers that are manually
      loaded or unloaded with no barrier technology separation should be sterilised
      before each load. For lyophilizers loaded and unloaded by automated systems or
      protected by closed barrier systems, the frequency of sterilisation should be
      justified and documented as part of the CCS.1

8.124 The integrity of the lyophilizer should be maintained following sterilisation and
      during lyophilization. The filter used to maintain lyophilizer integrity should be
      sterilised before each use of the system and its integrity testing results should be
      part of the batch certification/release. The frequency of vacuum/leak integrity
      testing of the chamber should be documented and the maximum permitted
      leakage of air into the lyophilizer should be specified and checked at the start of
      every cycle.

8.125 Lyophilization trays should be checked regularly to ensure that they are not
      misshapen or damaged.

8.126 Points to consider for the design of loading (and unloading, where the lyophilized
      material is still unsealed and exposed), include but are not limited to:

          i.   The loading pattern within the lyophilizer should be specified and
               documented.

         ii.   The transfer of partially closed containers to a lyophilizer should be
               undertaken under grade A conditions at all times and handled in a manner
               designed to minimize direct operator intervention. Technologies such as
               conveyor systems or portable transfer systems (e.g. clean air transfer carts,


1         This provision enters into force on 25 August 2024.


    PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -45-                            25 August 2023
                                     Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



              portable unidirectional airflow workstations) should be used to ensure that
              the cleanliness of the system used to transfer the partially closed containers
              is maintained. Alternatively, where supported by validation, trays closed in
              grade A and not reopened whilst in the grade B area may be used to protect
              partially stoppered vials (e.g. appropriately closed boxes).

       iii.   Airflow patterns should not be adversely affected by transport devices and
              venting of the loading zone.

      iv.     Unsealed containers (such as partially stoppered vials) should be maintained
              under grade A conditions and should normally be separated from operators
              by physical barrier technology or any other appropriate measures.

       v.     Where seating of the stoppers is not completed prior to opening the
              lyophilizer chamber, product removed from the lyophilizer should remain
              under grade A conditions during subsequent handling.

      vi.     Utensils used during loading and unloading of the lyophilizer (e.g. trays,
              bags, placing devices, tweezers) should be sterile.


CLOSED SYSTEMS

8.127 The use of closed systems can reduce the risk of microbial, particle and chemical
      contamination from the adjacent environment. Closed systems should always be
      designed to reduce the need for manual manipulations and the associated risks.

8.128 It is critical to ensure the sterility of all product contact surfaces of closed systems
      used for aseptic processing. The design and selection of any closed system used
      for aseptic processing should ensure maintenance of sterility. Connection of
      sterile equipment (e.g. tubing/pipework) to the sterilised product pathway after
      the final sterilising grade filter should be designed to be connected aseptically
      (e.g. by intrinsic sterile connection devices).

8.129 Appropriate measures should be in place to ensure the integrity of components
      used in aseptic connections. The means by which this is achieved should be
      determined and captured in the CCS. Appropriate system integrity tests should
      be considered when there is a risk of compromising product sterility. Supplier
      assessment should include the collation of data in relation to potential failure
      modes that may lead to a loss of system sterility.

8.130 The background environment in which closed systems are located should be
      based on their design and the processes undertaken. For aseptic processing and
      where there are any risks that system integrity may be compromised, the system
      should be located in grade A. If the system can be shown to remain integral at
      every usage (e.g. via pressure testing and/or monitoring) then a lower classified
      area may be used. Any transfer between classified areas should be thoroughly
      assessed (see paragraph 4.10). If the closed system is opened (e.g. for
      maintenance of a bulk manufacturing line) then this should be performed in a
      classified area appropriate to the materials (e.g. grade C for terminal sterilisation
      processes, or grade A for aseptic processing) or be subject to further cleaning
      and disinfection (and sterilisation in case of aseptic processes).



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -46-                            25 August 2023
                                     Annex 1         Manufacture of sterile medicinal products




SINGLE USE SYSTEMS (SUS)

8.131 SUS are those technologies used in manufacture of sterile products which are
      used as an alternative to reusable equipment. SUS can be individual components
      or made up of multiple components such as bags, filters, tubing, connectors,
      valves, storage bottles and sensors. Single use systems should be designed to
      reduce the need for manipulations and complexity of manual interventions.

8.132 There are some specific risks associated with SUS which should be assessed as
      part of the CCS. These risks include but are not limited to:

        i.   the interaction between the product and product contact surface (such as
             adsorption, or leachables and extractables),

       ii.   the fragile nature of the system compared with fixed reusable systems,

      iii.   the increase in the number and complexity of manual operations (including
             inspection and handling of the system) and connections made,

      iv.    the complexity of the assembly,

       v.    the performance of the pre- and post-use integrity testing for sterilising grade
             filters (see paragraph 8.87),

      vi.    the risk of holes and leakage,

      vii.   the potential for compromising the system at the point of opening the outer
             packaging,

     viii.   the risk of particle contamination.

8.133 Sterilisation processes for SUS should be validated and shown to have no
      adverse impact on system performance.

8.134 Assessment of suppliers of disposable systems including sterilisation is critical to
      the selection and use of these systems. For sterile SUS, verification of sterility
      assurance should be performed as part of the supplier qualification and evidence
      of sterilisation of each unit should be checked on receipt.

8.135 The adsorption and reactivity of the product with product contact surfaces should
      be evaluated under process conditions.

8.136 The extractable and leachable profiles of the SUS and any impact on the quality
      of the product especially where the system is made from polymer-based
      materials should be evaluated. An assessment should be carried out for each
      component to evaluate the applicability of the extractable profile data. For
      components considered to be at high risk from leachables, including those that
      may absorb processed materials or those with extended material contact times,
      an assessment of leachable profile studies, including safety concerns, should be
      taken into consideration. If applying simulated processing conditions, these
      should accurately reflect the actual processing conditions and be based on a
      scientific rationale.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -47-                            25 August 2023
                                    Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products




8.137 SUS should be designed to maintain integrity throughout processing under the
      intended operational conditions. Attention to the structural integrity of the single
      use components is necessary where these may be exposed to more extreme
      conditions (e.g. freezing and thawing processes) either during routine processing
      or transportation. This should include verification that intrinsic sterile connection
      devices (both heat sealed and mechanically sealed) remain integral under these
      conditions.

8.138 Acceptance criteria should be established and implemented for SUS
      corresponding to the risks or criticality of the products and its processes. On
      receipt, each piece of SUS should be checked to ensure that they have been
      manufactured, supplied and delivered in accordance with the approved
      specification. A visual inspection of the outer packaging (e.g. appearance of
      exterior carton, product pouches), label printing, and review of attached
      documents (e.g. certificate of conformance and proof of sterilisation) should be
      carried out and documented prior to use.

8.139 Critical manual handling operations of SUS such as assembly and connections
      should be subject to appropriate controls and verified during APS.


9      Environmental & process monitoring
GENERAL

9.1    The site’s environmental and process monitoring programme forms part of the
       overall CCS and is used to monitor the controls designed to minimize the risk of
       microbial and particle contamination. It should be noted that the reliability of each
       of the elements of the monitoring system (viable, non-viable and APS) when
       taken in isolation is limited and should not be considered individually to be an
       indicator of asepsis. When considered together, the results help confirm the
       reliability of the design, validation and operation of the system that they are
       monitoring.

9.2    This programme is typically comprised of the following elements:

       i.    environmental monitoring – total particle;
       ii.   environmental and personnel monitoring – viable particle;
      iii.   temperature, relative humidity and other specific characteristics;
      iv.    APS (aseptically manufactured product only).

9.3    The information from these systems should be used for routine batch
       certification/release and for periodic assessment during process review or
       investigation. This applies for both terminal sterilisation and aseptic processes,
       however, the criticality of the impact may differ depending upon the product and
       process type.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -48-                            25 August 2023
                                   Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



ENVIRONMENTAL AND PROCESS MONITORING

9.4    An environmental monitoring programme should be established and
       documented. The purpose of the environmental monitoring programme, is to:
       i.   Provide assurance that cleanrooms and clean air equipment continue to
            provide an environment of appropriate air cleanliness, in accordance with
            design and regulatory requirements.
      ii.   Effectively detect excursions from environmental limits triggering
            investigation and assessment of risk to product quality.
       Risk assessments should be performed in order to establish this comprehensive
       environmental monitoring programme, i.e. sampling locations, frequency of
       monitoring, monitoring methods and incubation conditions (e.g. time,
       temperature(s), aerobic and/or anaerobic conditions).

       These risk assessments should be conducted based on detailed knowledge of;
       the process inputs and final product, the facility, equipment, the criticality of
       specific processes and steps, the operations involved, routine monitoring data,
       monitoring data obtained during qualification and knowledge of typical microbial
       flora isolated from the environment.

       The risk assessment should include the determination of critical monitoring
       locations, those locations where the presence of microorganisms during
       processing may have an impact upon product quality, (e.g. grade A, aseptic
       processing areas and the grade B areas that directly interface with the grade A
       area). Consideration of other information such as air visualisation studies should
       also be included. These risk assessments should be reviewed regularly in order
       to confirm the effectiveness of the site’s environmental monitoring programme.
       The monitoring programme should be considered in the overall context of the
       trend analysis and the CCS for the site.

9.5    Routine monitoring of cleanrooms, clean air equipment and personnel should be
       performed in operation throughout all critical stages of processing, including
       equipment set-up.

9.6    Other characteristics, such as temperature and relative humidity, should be
       controlled within ranges that align with product/processing/personnel
       requirements and support maintenance of defined cleanliness standards (e.g.
       grade A or B).

9.7    The monitoring of grade A should demonstrate the maintenance of aseptic
       processing conditions during critical operations. Monitoring should be performed
       at locations posing the highest risk of contamination to the sterile equipment
       surfaces, containers, closures and product. The selection of monitoring locations
       and the orientation and positioning of sampling devices should be justified and
       appropriate to obtain reliable data from the critical zones.

9.8    Sampling methods should not pose a risk of contamination to the manufacturing
       operations.

9.9    Appropriate alert levels and action limits should be set for the results of viable
       and total particle monitoring. The maximum total particle action limits are


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -49-                            25 August 2023
                                     Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



        described in Table 5 and the maximum viable particle action limits are described
        in Table 6. However, more stringent action limits may be applied based on data
        trending, the nature of the process or as determined within the CCS. Both viable
        and total particle alert levels should be established based on results of cleanroom
        qualification tests and periodically reviewed based on ongoing trend data.

9.10    Alert levels for grade A (total particle only) grade B, grade C and grade D should
        be set such that adverse trends (e.g. a numbers of events or individual events
        that indicate a deterioration of environmental control) are detected and
        addressed.

9.11    Monitoring procedures should define the approach to trending. Trends should
        include, but are not limited to:

        i.    increasing numbers of excursions from action limits or alert levels;
       ii.    consecutive excursions from alert levels;
       iii.   regular but isolated excursion from action limits that may have a common
              cause, (e.g. single excursions that always follow planned preventative
              maintenance);
       iv.    changes in microbial flora type and numbers and predominance of specific
              organisms. Particular attention should be given to organisms recovered that
              may indicate a loss of control, deterioration in cleanliness or organisms that
              may be difficult to control such as spore-forming microorganisms and
              moulds.

9.12    The monitoring of grade C and D cleanrooms in operation should be performed
        based on data collected during qualification and routine data to allow effective
        trend analysis. The requirements of alert levels and action limits will depend on
        the nature of the operations carried out. Action limits may be more stringent than
        those listed in Table 5 and Table 6.

9.13    If action limits are exceeded, operating procedures should prescribe a root cause
        investigation, an assessment of the potential impact to product (including batches
        produced between the monitoring and reporting) and requirements for corrective
        and preventive actions. If alert levels are exceeded, operating procedures should
        prescribe assessment and follow-up, which should include consideration of an
        investigation and/or corrective actions to avoid any further deterioration of the
        environment.


ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING – TOTAL PARTICLE

9.14    A total particle monitoring program should be established to obtain data for
        assessing potential contamination risks and to ensure the maintenance of the
        environment for sterile operations in a qualified state.

9.15    The limits for environmental monitoring of airborne particle concentration for each
        graded area are given in Table 5.

       (a)   For grade D, in operation limits are not predetermined. The manufacturer should
             establish in operation limits based on a risk assessment and on routine data, where
             applicable.

       Note 1:     The particle limits given in the table for the “at rest” state should be achieved after
                   a short “clean up” period defined during qualification (guidance value of less than
                   20 minutes) in an unmanned state, after the completion of operations (see
                   paragraph 4.29).

       Note 2:     The occasional indication of macro particle counts, especially ≥ 5 µm, within
                   grade A may be considered to be false counts due to electronic noise, stray light,
                   coincidence loss etc. However, consecutive or regular counting of low levels may
                   be indicative of a possible contamination event and should be investigated. Such
                   events may indicate early failure of the room air supply filtration system,
                   equipment failure, or may also be diagnostic of poor practices during machine
                   set-up and routine operation.

9.16     For grade A, particle monitoring should be undertaken for the full duration of
         critical processing, including equipment assembly.

9.17     The grade A area should be monitored continuously (for particles ≥0.5 and
         ≥5 µm) and with a suitable sample flow rate (at least 28 litres (1ft 3) per minute)
         so that all interventions, transient events and any system deterioration is
         captured. The system should frequently correlate each individual sample result
         with alert levels and action limits at such a frequency that any potential excursion
         can be identified and responded to in a timely manner. Alarms should be triggered
         if alert levels are exceeded. Procedures should define the actions to be taken in
         response to alarms including the consideration of additional microbial monitoring.

9.18     It is recommended that a similar system be used for the grade B area although
         the sample frequency may be decreased. The grade B area should be monitored
         at such a frequency and with suitable sample size that the programme captures
         any increase in levels of contamination and system deterioration. If alert levels
         are exceeded, alarms should be triggered.

9.19     The selection of the monitoring system should take into account any risk
         presented by the materials used in the manufacturing operation (e.g. those
         involving live organisms, powdery products or radiopharmaceuticals) that may
         give rise to biological, chemical or radiation hazards.

9.20     In the case where contaminants are present due to the processes involved and
         would potentially damage the particle counter or present a hazard (e.g. live
         organisms, powdery products and radiation hazards), the frequency and strategy


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                               -51-                                25 August 2023
                                   Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       employed should be such as to assure the environmental classification both prior
       to and post exposure to the risk. An increase in viable particle monitoring should
       be considered to ensure comprehensive monitoring of the process. Additionally,
       monitoring should be performed during simulated operations. Such operations
       should be performed at appropriate intervals. The approach should be defined in
       the CCS.

9.21   The size of monitoring samples taken using automated systems will usually be a
       function of the sampling rate of the system used. It is not necessary for the
       sample volume to be the same as that used for formal classification of cleanrooms
       and clean air equipment. Monitoring sample volumes should be justified.


ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERSONNEL MONITORING – VIABLE PARTICLE

9.22   Where aseptic operations are performed, microbial monitoring should be frequent
       using a combination of methods such as settle plates, volumetric air sampling,
       glove, gown and surface sampling (e.g. swabs and contact plates). The method
       of sampling used should be justified within the CCS and should be demonstrated
       not to have a detrimental impact on grade A and B airflow patterns. Cleanroom
       and equipment surfaces should be monitored at the end of an operation.

9.23   Viable particle monitoring should also be performed within the cleanrooms when
       normal manufacturing operations are not occurring (e.g. post disinfection, prior to
       start of manufacturing, on completion of the batch and after a shutdown period),
       and in associated rooms that have not been used, in order to detect potential
       incidents of contamination which may affect the controls within the cleanrooms.
       In case of an incident, additional sample locations may be used as a verification
       of the effectiveness of a corrective action (e.g. cleaning and disinfection).

9.24   Continuous viable air monitoring in grade A (e.g. air sampling or settle plates)
       should be undertaken for the full duration of critical processing, including
       equipment (aseptic set-up) assembly and critical processing. A similar approach
       should be considered for grade B cleanrooms based on the risk of impact on the
       aseptic processing. The monitoring should be performed in such a way that all
       interventions, transient events and any system deterioration would be captured
       and any risk caused by interventions of the monitoring operations is avoided.

9.25   A risk assessment should evaluate the locations, type and frequency of personnel
       monitoring based on the activities performed and the proximity to critical zones.
       Monitoring should include sampling of personnel at periodic intervals during the
       process. Sampling of personnel should be performed in such a way that it will not
       compromise the process. Particular consideration should be given to monitoring
       personnel following involvement in critical interventions (at a minimum gloves,
       but may require monitoring of areas of gown as applicable to the process) and
       on each exit from the grade B cleanroom (gloves and gown). Where monitoring
       of gloves is performed after critical interventions, the outer gloves should be
       replaced prior to continuation of activity. Where monitoring of gowns is required
       after critical interventions, the gown should be replaced before further activity in
       the cleanroom.

9.26   Microbial monitoring of personnel in the grade A and grade B areas should be
       performed. Where operations are manual in nature (e.g. aseptic compounding or


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -52-                            25 August 2023
                                           Annex 1          Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



             filling), the increased risk should lead to enhanced emphasis placed on microbial
             monitoring of gowns and justified within the CCS.

9.27         Where monitoring is routinely performed by manufacturing personnel, this should
             be subject to regular oversight by the quality unit (refer also to paragraph 8.19).

9.28         The adoption of suitable alternative monitoring systems such as rapid methods
             should be considered by manufacturers in order to expedite the detection of
             microbiological contamination issues and to reduce the risk to product. These
             rapid and automated microbial monitoring methods may be adopted after
             validation has demonstrated their equivalency or superiority to the established
             methods.

9.29         Sampling methods and equipment used should be fully understood and
             procedures should be in place for the correct operation and interpretation of
             results obtained. Supporting data for the recovery efficiency of the sampling
             methods chosen should be available.

9.30         Action limits for viable particle contamination are shown in Table 6.

       (a)    -   Settle plates should be exposed in grade A and B areas for the duration of operations
                  (including equipment set-up) and changed as required after a maximum of 4 hours
                  (exposure time should be based on validation including recovery studies and it
                  should not have any negative effect on the suitability of the media used).
              -   For grade C and D areas, exposure time (with a maximum of 4 hours) and frequency
                  should be based on QRM.
              -   Individual settle plates may be exposed for less than 4 hours.
       (b)    Contact plate limits apply to equipment, room and gown surfaces within the grade A and
              grade B areas. Routine gown monitoring is not normally required for grade C and D
              areas, depending on their function.

       (c)    It should be noted that for grade A, any growth should result in an investigation.

       Note 1:       It should be noted that the types of monitoring methods listed in the table above
                     are examples and other methods can be used provided they meet the intent of
                     providing information across the whole of the critical process where product may
                     be contaminated (e.g. aseptic line set-up, aseptic processing, filling and
                     lyophilizer loading).

       Note 2:       Limits are applied using CFU throughout the document. If different or new
                     technologies are used that present results in a manner different from CFU, the
                     manufacturer should scientifically justify the limits applied and where possible
                     correlate them to CFU.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                                 -53-                            25 August 2023
                                     Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products




9.31    Microorganisms detected in the grade A and grade B areas should be identified
        to species level and the potential impact of such microorganisms on product
        quality (for each batch implicated) and overall state of control should be
        evaluated. Consideration should also be given to the identification of
        microorganisms detected in grade C and D areas (for example where action limits
        or alert levels are exceeded) or following the isolation of organisms that may
        indicate a loss of control, deterioration in cleanliness or that may be difficult to
        control such as spore-forming microorganisms and moulds and at a sufficient
        frequency to maintain a current understanding of the typical flora of these areas.


ASEPTIC PROCESS SIMULATION (APS) (ALSO KNOWN AS MEDIA FILL)

9.32    Periodic verification of the effectiveness of the controls in place for aseptic
        processing should include an APS using a sterile nutrient media and/or surrogate
        in place of the product. The APS should not be considered as the primary means
        to validate the aseptic process or aspects of the aseptic process. The
        effectiveness of the aseptic process should be determined through process
        design, adherence to the pharmaceutical quality system and process controls,
        training, and evaluation of monitoring data. Selection of an appropriate nutrient
        media and/or surrogate should be made based on the ability of the media and/or
        surrogate to imitate physical product characteristics assessed to pose a risk to
        product sterility during the aseptic process. Where processing stages may
        indirectly impact the viability of any introduced microbial contamination, (e.g.
        aseptically produced semi-solids, powders, solid materials, microspheres,
        liposomes and other formulations where product is cooled or heated or
        lyophilized), alternative procedures that represent the operations as closely as
        possible should be developed. Where surrogate materials, such as buffers, are
        used in parts of the APS, the surrogate material should not inhibit the growth of
        any potential contamination.

9.33    The APS should imitate as closely as possible the routine aseptic manufacturing
        process and include all the critical manufacturing steps, specifically:

        i.    The APS should assess all aseptic operations performed subsequent to the
              sterilisation and decontamination cycles of materials utilised in the process
              to the point where the container is sealed.

       ii.    For non-filterable formulations, any additional aseptic steps should be
              assessed.

       iii.   Where aseptic manufacturing is performed under an inert atmosphere, the
              inert gas should be substituted with air in the process simulation unless
              anaerobic simulation is intended.

       iv.    Processes requiring the addition of sterile powders should use an acceptable
              surrogate material in the same containers as those used in the process under
              evaluation.

       v.     Separate simulations of individual unit operations (e.g. processes involving
              drying, blending, milling and subdivision of a sterile powder) should be
              avoided. Any use of individual simulations should be supported by a
              documented justification and ensure that the sum total of the individual


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -54-                            25 August 2023
                                     Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



              simulations continues to fully cover the whole process.

       vi.    The process simulation procedure for lyophilized products should represent
              the entire aseptic processing chain including filling, transport, loading, a
              representative duration of the chamber dwell, unloading and sealing under
              specified, documented and justified conditions representing worst case
              operating parameters.

       vii.   The lyophilization process simulation should mimic all aspects of the
              process, except those that may affect the viability or recovery of
              contaminants. For instance, boiling-over or actual freezing of the solution
              should be avoided. Factors to consider in determining APS design include,
              where applicable:

                    the use of air to break vacuum instead of nitrogen or other process
                     gases,

                    replicating the maximum interval between sterilisation of the
                     lyophilizer and its use,

                    replicating the maximum period of time between filtration and
                     lyophilization, and

                    quantitative aspects of worst-case situations, e.g. loading the largest
                     number of trays, replicating the longest duration of loading where the
                     chamber is open to the environment.

9.34     The APS should take into account various aseptic manipulations and
         interventions known to occur during normal production as well as worst-case
         situations, and take into account the following:

         i.   Inherent and corrective interventions representative of the routine process
              should be performed in a manner and frequency similar to that during the
              routine aseptic process.

        ii.   The inclusion and frequency of interventions in the APS should be based on
              assessed risks posed to product sterility.

9.35     APS should not be used to justify practices that pose unnecessary contamination
         risks.

9.36     In developing the APS plan, consideration should be given to the following:

         i.   Identification of worst case conditions covering the relevant variables, such
              as container size and line speed, and their impact on the process. The
              outcome of the assessment should justify the variables selected.

        ii.   Determining the representative sizes of container/closure combinations to be
              used for validation. Bracketing or matrix approach may be considered for
              validation of the same container/closure configuration for different products
              where process equivalence is scientifically justified.

       iii.   Maximum permitted holding times for sterile product and equipment exposed


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -55-                            25 August 2023
                                      Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



               during the aseptic process.

        iv.    The volume filled per container, which should be sufficient to ensure that the
               media contacts all equipment and component surfaces that may directly
               contaminate the sterile product. The volume used should provide sufficient
               headspace to support potential microbial growth and ensure that turbidity can
               be detected during inspection.

         v.    The requirement for substitution of any inert gas used in the routine aseptic
               manufacturing process by air unless anaerobic simulation is intended. In
               these situations, inclusion of occasional anaerobic simulations as part of the
               overall validation strategy should be considered (see paragraph 9.33 point
               iii).

        vi.    The selected nutrient media should be capable of growing a designated
               group of reference microorganisms as described by the relevant
               pharmacopeia and suitably representative local isolates.

       vii.    The method of detection of microbial contamination should be scientifically
               justified to ensure that contamination is reliably detected.

       viii.   The process simulation should be of sufficient duration to challenge the
               process, the operators that perform interventions, shift changes and the
               capability of the processing environment to provide appropriate conditions
               for the manufacture of a sterile product.

        ix.    Where the manufacturer operates different or extended shifts, the APS
               should be designed to capture factors specific to those shifts that are
               assessed to pose a risk to product sterility, for example the maximum
               duration for which an operator may be present in the cleanroom.

         x.    Simulating normal aseptic manufacturing interruptions where the process is
               idle (e.g. shift changeovers, recharging dispensing vessels, introduction of
               additional equipment).

        xi.    Ensuring that environmental monitoring is conducted as required for routine
               production, and throughout the entire duration of the process simulation.

       xii.    Where campaign manufacturing occurs, such as in the use of Barrier
               Technologies or manufacture of sterile active substances, consideration
               should be given to designing and performing the process simulation so that
               it simulates the risks associated with both the beginning and the end of the
               campaign and demonstrating that the campaign duration does not pose any
               risk.

       xiii.   The performance of "end of production or campaign APS" may be used as
               additional assurance or investigative purposes; however, their use should be
               justified in the CCS and should not replace routine APS. If used, it should be
               demonstrated that any residual product does not negatively impact the
               recovery of any potential microbial contamination.

9.37     For sterile active substances, batch size should be large enough to represent
         routine operation, simulate intervention operation at the worst case, and cover all


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -56-                            25 August 2023
                                    Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       surfaces that may come into contact with the sterile product. In addition, all the
       simulated materials (surrogates or growth medium) should be subjected to
       microbial evaluation. The simulation materials should be sufficient to satisfy the
       evaluation of the process being simulated and should not compromise the
       recovery of micro-organisms.

9.38   APS should be performed as part of the initial validation, with at least three
       consecutive satisfactory simulation tests that cover all working shifts that the
       aseptic process may occur in, and after any significant modification to operational
       practices, facilities, services or equipment which are assessed to have an impact
       on the sterility assurance of the product (e.g. modification to the HVAC system,
       equipment, changes to process, number of shifts and numbers of personnel,
       major facility shut down). Normally, APS (periodic revalidation) should be
       repeated twice a year (approximately every six months) for each aseptic process,
       each filling line and each shift. Each operator should participate in at least one
       successful APS annually. Consideration should be given to performing an APS
       after the last batch prior to shut down, before long periods of inactivity or before
       decommissioning or relocation of a line.

9.39   Where manual operation (e.g. aseptic compounding or filling) occurs, each type
       of container, container closure and equipment train should be initially validated
       with each operator participating in at least 3 consecutive successful APS and
       revalidated with one APS approximately every 6 months for each operator. The
       APS batch size should mimic that used in the routine aseptic manufacturing
       process.

9.40   The number of units processed (filled) for APS should be sufficient to effectively
       simulate all activities that are representative of the aseptic manufacturing
       process. Justification for the number of units to be filled should be clearly
       captured in the CCS. Typically, a minimum of 5000 to 10000 units are filled. For
       small batches (e.g. those under 5000 units), the number of containers for APS
       should at least equal the size of the production batch.

9.41   Filled APS units should be agitated, swirled or inverted before incubation to
       ensure contact of the media with all interior surfaces in the container. All integral
       units from the APS should be incubated and evaluated, including units with
       cosmetic defects or those which have gone through non-destructive in-process
       control checks. If units are discarded during the process simulation and not
       incubated, these should be comparable with units discarded during a routine fill,
       and only if production SOPs clearly specify that units must be removed under the
       same circumstances (i.e. type of intervention; line location; specific number of
       units removed). In no case should more units be removed during a media fill
       intervention than would be cleared during a production run. Examples may
       include those that must be discarded during routine production after the set-up
       process or following a specific type of intervention. To fully understand the
       process and assess contamination risks during aseptic setup or mandatory line
       clearances, these units would typically be incubated separately, and would not
       necessarily be included in the acceptance criteria for the APS.

9.42   Where processes include materials that contact the product contact surfaces but
       are then discarded (e.g. product flushes), the discarded material should be
       simulated with nutrient media and be incubated as part of the APS, unless it can
       be clearly demonstrated that this waste process would not impact the sterility of
       the product.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -57-                            25 August 2023
                                       Annex 1       Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



9.43    Filled APS units should be incubated in a clear container to ensure visual
        detection of microbial growth. Where the product container is not clear (e.g.
        amber glass, opaque plastic), clear containers of identical configuration may be
        substituted to aid in the detection of contamination. When a clear container of
        identical configuration cannot be substituted, a suitable method for the detection
        of microbial growth should be developed and validated. Microorganisms isolated
        from contaminated units should be identified to the species level when practical,
        to assist in the determination of the likely source of the contaminant.

9.44    Filled APS units should be incubated without unnecessary delay to achieve the
        best possible recovery of potential contamination. The selection of the incubation
        conditions and duration should be scientifically justified and validated to provide
        an appropriate level of sensitivity of detection of microbial contamination.

9.45    On completion of incubation:

        i.    Filled APS units should be inspected by personnel who have been
              appropriately trained and qualified for the detection of microbiological
              contamination. Inspection should be conducted under conditions that
              facilitate the identification of any microbial contamination.


       ii.    Samples of the filled units should undergo positive control by inoculation
              with a suitable range of reference organisms and suitably representative
              local isolates.


9.46    The target should be zero growth. Any contaminated unit should result in a failed
        APS and the following actions should be taken:

        i.    an investigation to determine the most probable root cause(s);

       ii.    determination and implementation of appropriate corrective measures;

       iii.   a sufficient number of successful, consecutive repeat APS (normally a
              minimum of 3) should be conducted in order to demonstrate that the process
              has been returned to a state of control;

       iv.    a prompt review of all appropriate records relating to aseptic production since
              the last successful APS;

              a) The outcome of the review should include a risk assessment of potential
                 sterile breaches in batches manufactured since the last successful APS.
              b) All other batches not released to the market should be included in the
                 scope of the investigation. Any decision regarding their release status
                 should consider the investigation outcome.

       v.     all products that have been manufactured on a line subsequent to a process
              simulation failure should be quarantined until a successful resolution of the
              process simulation failure has occurred;

       vi.    where the root cause investigation indicates that the failure was related to
              operator activity, actions to limit the operator’s activities, until retrained and



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -58-                             25 August 2023
                                      Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



              requalified, should be taken;

       vii.   production should resume only after completion of successful revalidation.

9.47     All APS runs should be fully documented and include a reconciliation of units
         processed (e.g. units filled, incubated and not incubated). Justification for filled
         and non-incubated units should be included in the documentation. All
         interventions performed during the APS should be recorded, including the start
         and end time of each intervention and the involved person. All microbial
         monitoring data as well as other testing data should be recorded in the APS batch
         record.

9.48     An APS run should be aborted only under circumstances in which written
         procedures require commercial lots to be equally handled. An investigation
         should be documented in such cases.

9.49     An aseptic process should be subject to a repeat of the initial validation when:

         i.   the specific aseptic process has not been in operation for an extended period
              of time; or

        ii.   there is a change to the process, equipment, procedures or environment that
              has the potential to affect the aseptic process or an addition of new product
              containers or container-closure combinations.


10       Quality Control (QC)
10.1     There should be personnel available with appropriate training and experience in
         microbiology, sterility assurance and knowledge of the processes to support the
         design of the manufacturing activities, environmental monitoring regime and any
         investigation assessing the impact of microbiologically linked events to the safety
         of the sterile product.

10.2     Specifications for raw materials, components and products should include
         requirements for microbial, particulate and endotoxin/pyrogen limits when the
         need for this has been indicated by monitoring and/or by the CCS.

10.3     The bioburden assay should be performed on each batch for both aseptically
         filled product and terminally sterilised products and the results considered as part
         of the final batch review. There should be defined limits for bioburden immediately
         before the final sterilising grade filter or the terminal sterilisation process, which
         are related to the efficiency of the method to be used. Samples should be taken
         to be representative of the worst case scenario (e.g. at the end of hold time).
         Where overkill sterilisation parameters are set for terminally sterilised products,
         bioburden should be monitored at suitable scheduled intervals.

10.4     For products authorised for parametric release, a supporting pre-sterilisation
         bioburden monitoring programme for the filled product prior to initiating the
         sterilisation cycle should be developed and the bioburden assay should be
         performed for each batch. The sampling locations of filled units before
         sterilisation should be based on a worst case scenario and be representative of



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -59-                            25 August 2023
                                     Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



        the batch. Any organisms found during bioburden testing should be identified and
        their impact on the effectiveness of the sterilising process determined. Where
        appropriate, the level of endotoxin/pyrogen should be monitored.

10.5    The sterility test applied to the finished product should only be regarded as the
        last in a series of critical control measures by which sterility is assured. It cannot
        be used to assure sterility of a product that does not meet its design, procedural
        or validation parameters. The test should be validated for the product concerned.

10.6    The sterility test should be performed under aseptic conditions. Samples taken
        for sterility testing should be representative of the whole of the batch but should
        in particular include samples taken from parts of the batch considered to be most
        at risk of contamination, for example:

        i.    For products which have been filled aseptically, samples should include
              containers filled at the beginning and end of the batch. Additional samples,
              e.g. taken after critical interventions should be considered based on risk.

       ii.    For products which have been heat sterilised in their final containers,
              samples taken should be representative of the worst case locations (e.g. the
              potentially coolest or slowest to heat part of each load).

       iii.   For products which have been lyophilized, samples taken from different
              lyophilization loads.

        Note: Where the manufacturing process results in sub-batches (e.g. for
        terminally sterilised products) then sterility samples from each sub-batch should
        be taken and a sterility test for each sub-batch performed. Consideration should
        also be given to performing separate testing for other finished product tests.

10.7    For some products it may not be possible to obtain a sterility test result prior to
        release because the shelf life of the product is too short to allow completion of a
        sterility test. In these cases, the additional considerations of design of the process
        and additional monitoring and/or alternative test methods required to mitigate the
        identified risks should be assessed and documented.

10.8    Any process (e.g. Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide, Ultra Violet) used to
        decontaminate the external surfaces of sterility samples prior to testing should
        not negatively impact the sensitivity of the test method or the reliability of the
        sample.

10.9    Media used for product testing should be quality control tested according to the
        related Pharmacopeia before use. Media used for environmental monitoring and
        APS should be tested for growth promotion before use, using a scientifically
        justified and designated group of reference microorganisms and including
        suitably representative local isolates. Media quality control testing should
        normally be performed by the end user. Any reliance on outsourced testing or
        supplier testing of media should be justified and transportation and shipping
        conditions should be thoroughly considered in this case.

10.10 Environmental monitoring data and trend data generated for classified areas
      should be reviewed as part of product batch certification/release. A written
      procedure should be available that describes the actions to be taken when data


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -60-                            25 August 2023
                                     Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



       from environmental monitoring are found out of trend or exceeding the
       established limits. For products with short shelf life, the environmental data for
       the time of manufacture may not be available; in these cases, the compliance
       should include a review of the most recent available data. Manufacturers of these
       products should consider the use of rapid/alternative methods.

10.11 Where rapid and automated microbial methods are used for general
      manufacturing purposes, these methods should be validated for the product(s) or
      processes concerned.


Glossary
Airlock – An enclosed space with interlocked doors, constructed to maintain air pressure
control between adjoining rooms (generally with different air cleanliness standards). The
intent of an airlock is to preclude ingress of particle matter and microorganism
contamination from a lesser controlled area.

Action limit – An established relevant measure (e.g. microbial, or airborne particle limits)
that, when exceeded, should trigger appropriate investigation and corrective action
based on the investigation.

Alert level – An established relevant measure (e.g. microbial, or airborne particle levels)
giving early warning of potential drift from normal operating conditions and validated
state, which does not necessarily give grounds for corrective action but triggers
appropriate scrutiny and follow-up to address the potential problem. Alert levels are
established based on routine and qualification trend data and are periodically reviewed.
The alert level can be based on a number of parameters including adverse trends,
individual excursions above a set limit and repeat events.

Aseptic preparation/processing – The handling of sterile product, containers and/or
devices in a controlled environment in which the air supply, materials and personnel are
regulated to prevent microbial, endotoxin/pyrogen and particle contamination.

Aseptic Process Simulation (APS) – A simulation of the entire aseptic manufacturing
process in order to verify the capability of the process to assure product sterility. Includes
all aseptic operations associated with routine manufacturing, e.g. equipment assembly,
formulation, filling, lyophilization and sealing processes as necessary.

Asepsis – A state of control attained by using an aseptic work area and performing
activities in a manner that precludes microbial contamination of the exposed sterile
product.

Bacterial retention testing – This test is performed to validate that a filter can remove
bacteria from a gas or liquid. The test is usually performed using a standard organism,
such as Brevundimonas diminuta at a minimum concentration of 107 Colony Forming
Units/cm2.

Barrier – A physical partition that affords aseptic processing area (usually grade A)
protection by separating it from the background environment. Such systems frequently
use in part or totally the Barrier Technologies known as RABS or isolators.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -61-                            25 August 2023

Bioburden – The total number of microorganisms associated with a specific item such as
personnel, manufacturing environments (air and surfaces), equipment, product
packaging, raw materials (including water), in-process materials, or finished products.

Bio-decontamination - A process that eliminates viable bioburden via use of sporicidal
chemical agents.

Biological Indicators (BI) – A population of microorganisms inoculated onto a suitable
medium (e.g. solution, container or closure) and placed within a steriliser or load or room
locations to determine the sterilisation or disinfection cycle efficacy of a physical or
chemical process. The challenge microorganism is selected and validated based upon
its resistance to the given process. Incoming lot D-value, microbiological count and purity
define the quality of the BI.

Blow-Fill-Seal (BFS) – A technology in which containers are formed from a thermoplastic
granulate, filled with product, and then sealed in a continuous, integrated, automatic
operation. The two most common types of BFS machines are the Shuttle type (with
Parison cut) and the Rotary type (Closed Parison).

Campaign manufacture – A manufacture of a series of batches of the same product in
sequence in a given period of time with strict adherence to established and validated
control measures.

Classified area – An area that contains a number of cleanrooms (see cleanroom
definition).

Cleaning – A process for removing contamination e.g. product residues or disinfectant
residues.

Clean area – An area with defined particle and microbiological cleanliness standards
usually containing a number of joined cleanrooms.

Cleanroom – A room designed, maintained, and controlled to prevent particle and
microbial contamination of drug products. Such a room is assigned and reproducibly
meets an appropriate air cleanliness level.

Cleanroom classification – A method of assessing the level of air cleanliness against a
specification for a cleanroom or clean air equipment by measuring the total particle
concentration.

Cleanroom qualification – A method of assessing the level of compliance of a classified
cleanroom or clean air equipment with its intended use.

Closed system – A system in which the product is not exposed to the surrounding
environment. For example, this can be achieved by the use of bulk product holders (such
as tanks or bags) that are connected to each other by pipes or tubes as a system, and
where used for sterile products, the full system is sterilised after the connections are
made. Examples of these can be (but are not limited to) large scale reusable systems,
such as those seen in active substance manufacturing, or disposable bag and manifold
systems, such as those seen in the manufacture of biological products. Closed systems
are not opened until the conclusion of an operation. The use of the term “closed systems”
in this Annex does not refer to systems such as RABS or isolator systems.

                                     Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



Colony Forming Unit (CFU) – A microbiological term that describes a single detectable
colony that originates from one or more microorganisms. Colony forming units are
typically expressed as CFU per ml for liquid samples, CFU per m3 for air sample and
CFU per sample for samples captured on solid medium such as settle or contact plates.

Contamination – The undesired introduction of impurities of a microbiological nature
(quantity and type of microorganisms, pyrogen), or of foreign particle matter, into or onto
a raw material, intermediate, active substance or drug product during production,
sampling, packaging or repackaging, storage or transport with the potential to adversely
impact product quality.

Contamination Control Strategy (CCS) – A planned set of controls for microorganisms,
endotoxin/pyrogen and particles, derived from current product and process
understanding that assures process performance and product quality. The controls can
include parameters and attributes related to active substance, excipient and drug product
materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process
controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of
monitoring and control.

Corrective intervention – An intervention that is performed to correct or adjust an aseptic
process during its execution. These may not occur at a set frequency in the routine
aseptic process. Examples include such as clearing component jams, stopping leaks,
adjusting sensors, and replacing equipment components.

Critical surfaces – Surfaces that may come directly into contact with, or directly affect, a
sterile product or its containers or closures. Critical surfaces are rendered sterile prior to
the start of the manufacturing operation, and sterility is maintained throughout
processing.

Critical zone – A location within the aseptic processing area in which product and critical
surfaces are exposed to the environment.

Critical intervention – An intervention (corrective or inherent) into the critical zone.

D-value – The value of a parameter of sterilisation (duration or absorbed dose) required
to reduce the number of viable organisms to 10 per cent of the original number.

Dead leg – Length of non-circulating pipe (where fluid may remain static) that is greater
than 3 internal pipe diameters.

Decommission – When a process, equipment or cleanroom are closed and they will not
be used again.

Decontamination – The overall process of removal or reduction of any contaminants
(chemical, waste, residue or microorganisms) from an area, object, or person. The
method of decontamination used (e.g. cleaning, disinfection, sterilisation) should be
chosen and validated to achieve a level of cleanliness appropriate to the intended use of
the item decontaminated. See also Bio-decontamination.

Depyrogenation – A process designed to remove or inactivate pyrogenic material (e.g.
endotoxin) to a specified minimum quantity.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -63-                            25 August 2023
                                      Annex 1         Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



Disinfection – The process by which the reduction of the number of microorganisms is
achieved by the irreversible action of a product on their structure or metabolism, to a
level deemed to be appropriate for a defined purpose.

Endotoxin – A pyrogenic product (i.e. lipopolysaccharide) present in the Gram negative
bacterial cell wall. Endotoxin can lead to reactions in patients receiving injections ranging
from fever to death.

Equilibration time – Period which elapses between the attainment of the sterilisation
temperature at the reference measurement point and the attainment of the sterilisation
temperature at all points within the load.

Extractables - Chemical entities that migrate from the surface of the process equipment,
exposed to an appropriate solvent at extreme conditions, into the product or material
being processed.

First Air – Refers to filtered air that has not been interrupted prior to contacting exposed
product and product contact surfaces with the potential to add contamination to the air
prior to reaching the critical zone.

Filter Integrity test - A test to confirm that a filter (product, gas or HVAC filter) retain their
retentive properties and have not been damaged during handling, installation or
processing.

Form-Fill-Seal (FFS) –An automated filling process, typically used for terminally sterilised
products, which constructs the primary container out of a continuous flat roll of packaging
film while simultaneously filling the formed container with product and sealing the filled
containers in a continuous process. FFS processes may utilize a single web system
(where a single flat roll of film is wrapped around itself to form a cavity), or a dual web
system (where two flat rolls of film are brought together to form a cavity), often with the
aid of vacuum moulds or pressurised gases. The formed cavity is filled, sealed and cut
into sections. Films typically consist of a polymeric material, polymeric coated foil or other
suitable material.

Gowning qualification – A programme that establishes, both initially and on a periodic
basis, the capability of an individual to don the complete gown.

Grade A air supply – Air which is passed through a filter qualified as capable of producing
grade A total particle quality air, but where there is no requirement to perform continuous
total particle monitoring or meet grade A viable monitoring limits. Specifically used for
the protection of fully stoppered vials where the cap has not yet been crimped.

HEPA filter – High efficiency particulate air filter specified in accordance with a relevant
international standard.

Inherent interventions – An intervention that is an integral part of the aseptic process and
is required for either set-up, routine operation and/or monitoring (e.g. aseptic assembly,
container replenishment, environmental sampling). Inherent interventions are required
by procedure or work instruction for the execution of the aseptic process.

Intrinsic sterile connection device – A device that reduces the risk of contamination during
the connection process; these can be mechanical or fusion sealing.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                           -64-                             25 August 2023
                                     Annex 1        Manufacture of sterile medicinal products



Isokinetic sampling head – A sampling head designed to disturb the air as little as
possible so that the same particles go into the nozzle as would have passed the area if
the nozzle had not been there (i.e. the sampling condition in which the mean velocity of
the air entering the sample probe inlet is nearly the same (± 20 percent) as the mean
velocity of the airflow at that location).

Isolator – An enclosure capable of being subject to reproducible interior bio-
decontamination, with an internal work zone meeting grade A conditions that provides
uncompromised, continuous isolation of its interior from the external environment (e.g.
surrounding cleanroom air and personnel). There are two major types of isolators:

        i.   Closed isolator systems exclude external contamination of the isolator’s
             interior by accomplishing material transfer via aseptic connection to auxiliary
             equipment, rather than use of openings to the surrounding environment.
             Closed systems remain sealed throughout operations.
       ii.   Open isolator systems are designed to allow for the continuous or semi-
             continuous ingress and/or egress of materials during operations through one
             or more openings. Openings are engineered (e.g. using continuous
             overpressure) to exclude the entry of external contaminant into the isolator.

Leachables – Chemical entities that migrate into products from the product contact
surface of the process equipment or containers under normal condition of use and/or
storage.

Local isolates – Suitably representative microorganisms of the site that are frequently
recovered through environmental monitoring within the classified zone/areas especially
grade A and B areas, personnel monitoring or positive sterility test results.

Lyophilization – A physical-chemical drying process designed to remove solvents, by
way of sublimation, from both aqueous and non-aqueous systems, primarily to achieve
product or material stability. Lyophilization is synonymous to the term freeze-drying.

Manual aseptic processing– An aseptic process where the operator manually
compounds, fills, places and /or seals an open container with sterile product.

Operator - Any individual participating in the processing operation, including line set-up,
filling, maintenance, or other personnel associated with manufacturing activities.

Overkill sterilisation – A process that is sufficient to provide at least a 12 log 10 reduction
of microorganisms having a minimum D-value of 1 minute.

Parison – The "tube" of polymer extruded by the BFS machine from which containers
are formed.

Pass-through hatch – Synonymous with airlock (see airlock definition) but typically
smaller in size.

Patient – Human or animal including participants in a clinical trial.

Post-aseptic processing terminal heat treatment– A terminal moist heat process
employed after aseptic processing which has been demonstrated to provide a sterility
assurance level (SAL) ≤10-6 but where the requirements of steam sterilisation (for

example, F0≥8 min) are not fulfilled. This may also be beneficial in the destruction of
viruses that may not be removed through filtration.

Pyrogen – A substance that induces a febrile reaction in patients receiving injections;

Rapid Transfer System/Port (RTP) – A System used for the transfer of items into RABS
or isolators that minimizes the risk to the critical zone. An example would be a rapid
transfer container with an alpha/beta port.

Raw material – Any ingredient intended for use in the manufacture of a sterile product,
including those that may not appear in the final drug product.

Restricted Access Barrier System (RABS) – System that provides an enclosed, but not
fully sealed, environment meeting defined air quality conditions (for aseptic processing
grade A), and using a rigid-wall enclosure and integrated gloves to separate its interior
from the surrounding cleanroom environment. The inner surfaces of the RABS are
disinfected and decontaminated with a sporicidal agent. Operators use gloves, half suits,
RTPs and other integrated transfer ports to perform manipulations or convey materials
to the interior of the RABS. Depending on the design, doors are rarely opened, and only
under strictly pre-defined conditions.

Single Use Systems (SUS) – Systems in which product contact components are used
only once to replace reusable equipment such as stainless steel transfer lines or bulk
containers. SUS covered in this document are those that are used in manufacturing
processes of sterile products and are typically made up of disposable components such
as bags, filters, tubing, connectors, storage bottles and sensors.

Sporicidal agent – An agent that destroys bacterial and fungal spores when used in
sufficient concentration for specified contact time. It is expected to kill all vegetative
microorganisms.

Sterile Product – For purpose of this guidance, sterile product refers to one or more of
the sterilised elements exposed to aseptic conditions and ultimately making up the sterile
active substance or finished sterile product. These elements include the containers,
closures, and components of the finished drug product. Or, a product that is rendered
sterile by a terminal sterilisation process.

Sterilising grade filter – A filter that, when appropriately validated, will remove a defined
microbial challenge from a fluid or gas producing a sterile effluent. Usually such filters
have a pore size equal or less than 0.22 µm.

Terminal Sterilisation – The application of a lethal sterilising agent or conditions to a
product in its final container to achieve a predetermined sterility assurance level (SAL)
of 10⁻⁶ or better (e.g. the theoretical probability of there being a single viable
microorganism present on or in a sterilised unit is equal to or less than 1 x 10-6 (one in a
million)).

Turbulent airflow – Air that is not unidirectional. Turbulent air in cleanrooms should flush
the cleanroom via mixed flow dilution and ensure maintenance of acceptable air quality.

Unidirectional airflow – An airflow moving in a single direction, in a robust and uniform
manner, and at sufficient speed, to reproducibly sweep particles away from the critical
processing or testing area.

Unidirectional Airflow (UDAF) unit – A cabinet supplied with filtered unidirectional airflow
(previously referred to as a Laminar Airflow Unit or LAF).

Worst case – A set of conditions encompassing processing limits and circumstances,
including those within standard operating procedures, that pose the greatest chance of
process or product failure (when compared with ideal conditions). Such conditions have
the highest potential to, but do not necessarily always result in product or process failure.

Water system – A system for producing, storing and distributing water, usually compliant
to a specific pharmacopeia grade (e.g. purified water and water for injection (WFI)).

Z-value – The temperature difference that leads to a 10-fold change in the D-value of the

ANNEX 2A


MANUFACTURE OF ADVANCED THERAPY MEDICINAL
        PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE


SCOPE
      The methods employed in the manufacture of Advanced Therapy Medicinal
      Products (ATMPs) are a critical factor in shaping the appropriate regulatory
      control. ATMPs can be defined therefore largely by reference to their method of
      manufacture. For example, for gene therapy ATMPs, genetic modifications can
      be obtained through a variety of methods (e.g. viral & non-viral vectors, mRNA,
      ex vivo and in vivo genome-editing tools). The genetically modified cells can be
      of human origin (autologous or allogeneic) or of animal origin (xenogeneic cells),
      either primary or established cell lines. In a medicinal product, the genetically
      modified cells or gene therapy products can be presented alone or combined with
      medical devices.

      This annex provides additional and specific guidance on the full range of ATMPs
      (as defined in the glossary) and the active substances that are used in their
      manufacture. This annex applies both to investigational ATMPs and market-
      authorised ATMPs. It can also be applied to ATMP manufacturing in hospital
      settings and for compassionate use programs, where authorised by national law.

      Although one of the objectives of this present annex was to prepare a document
      that would stand for several years, the field is quickly changing. It is recognised
      that amendments may be necessary to accommodate technological change, to
      clarify uncertainty or to specifically recognise important alternatives. Comments
      are therefore invited at any stage of the life of this edition.

      This annex is divided into two main parts:

      1.    Part A contains supplementary guidance and alternative provisions on the
            manufacture of ATMPs, from control over seed lots and cell banks through
            to finishing activities and testing.

      2.    Part B contains further guidance on selected types of ATMPs and its
            substances.


      APPLICATION OF THIS ANNEX

      This annex, along with several other annexes of the Guide to GMP, provides
      guidance, which supplements that in Part I: Basic Requirements for Medicinal
      Products and in Part II: Basic Requirements for active pharmaceutical ingredients
      of the PIC/S GMP Guide. This annex is not a stand-alone document and should
      be applied in conjunction with PIC/S GMP guidelines and annexes. It has



PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -68-                           25 August 2023
      Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



      however been written in a manner that it could enable development of a
      standalone guide if integrated with PIC/S GMP Part I, Part II, and related
      annexes.

      Where due to the nature of the product or technical necessities, specific guidance
      is provided in this annex, compliance with this annex is expected and takes
      precedence over other sections in the PIC/S GMP Guide unless there are good
      reasons for not doing so with documented sound scientific rationale applied using
      QRM principles.

     In certain cases, other national laws may be applicable to the starting materials
     for ATMPs. For example:

     (a) Tissues and cells used as starting materials of ATMPs may be subject to
         other national legislation that cover donation, procurement, testing,
         processing, preservation, storage and distribution.

     (b) For blood or blood components used as starting materials for ATMPs,
         national legislation may provide the technical requirements for the selection
         of donors and the collection and testing of blood and blood components.

     The manufacturing process for ATMPs is product-specific and different design
     approaches are possible. The appropriate application of GMP should be
     described, justified in the Clinical Trial Application (CTA) or Marketing
     Authorisation (MA), and in accordance with national law. Consideration may be
     given to defining which manufacturing process steps are required to manufacture
     starting materials, ATMP active substance, or the finished ATMP. In some cases,
     the manufacturing process between the ATMP active substance and the final
     product can be defined as continuous.

     The manufacture and control of genetically modified organisms also needs to
     comply with other local, national or regional requirements. Appropriate
     containment should be established and maintained in facilities where any
     genetically modified organism is handled. Advice should be obtained according
     to national law in order to establish and maintain the appropriate Biological Safety
     Level. GMP should be adhered alongside these requirements.

     Table 1 gives examples of where this annex applies. It should be noted that this
     table is illustrative only and is not meant to describe the precise scope. It should
     also be understood that adherence to the GMP or GMP principles for the
     manufacturing steps indicated in the corresponding table is dependent on
     applicable national legislation. The level of GMP requirements increases from
     early to later steps in the manufacture of ATMP active substances. The inclusion
     of some early steps of manufacture within the scope of this annex does not imply
     that those steps will be routinely subject to inspection by the authorities.
     According to national legislation more or less stringent approaches on the
     application of GMP on those early stages may apply.

 PRINCIPLE
         The manufacture of ATMPs involves certain specific considerations arising from
         the nature of the products and the processes. The ways in which biological
         medicinal products are manufactured, controlled and administered make some
         particular precautions necessary.

         Since materials and processing conditions used in manufacturing processes are
         designed to provide conditions for the growth of specific cells and
         microorganisms, this provides an opportunity for extraneous microbial
         contaminants (e.g. bacteria, fungi) to grow. In addition, some products may be
         limited in their ability to withstand a wide range of purification techniques,
         particularly those designed to inactivate or remove adventitious viral


  PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -72-                           25 August 2023
      Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



      contaminants. The design of the processes, equipment, facilities, utilities, the
      conditions of preparation and addition of buffers and reagents, sampling and
      training of the operators are key considerations to minimise such contamination
      events (i.e. engineering and technical controls). In addition, manufacturing
      processes need to be well designed and controlled so as not to add further
      variability to the product.

      Product specifications such as those in pharmacopoeial monographs, CTA, and
      MA will dictate whether and to what manufacturing stage substances and
      materials can have a defined level of bioburden or need to be sterile. Similarly,
      manufacturing must be consistent with other specifications set out in the CTA or
      MA (e.g. number of generations (doublings, passages) between the seed lot or
      cell bank).

     For biological materials that cannot be sterilized (e.g. by filtration), processing
     must be conducted aseptically to minimise the introduction of contaminants.
     Where they exist, other guidance documents should be consulted on the
     validation of specific manufacturing methods (e.g. virus removal or inactivation).
     The application of appropriate environmental controls and monitoring and,
     wherever feasible, in-situ cleaning and sterilisation systems together with the use
     of closed systems and sterile disposable product-contact equipment can
     significantly reduce the risk of accidental contamination and cross-contamination.

     ATMPs require a combination of unique biological methods and standard
     physico-chemical assays for their Quality Control (QC). For many cell-based
     products, there is variability introduced through the starting materials that cannot
     be overcome by the manufacturing process or In-Process Controls (IPCs).
     Adequate control of the starting and raw materials, well defined characterisation
     of the ATMP active substance and ATMP drug product release testing form the
     crucial part of the QC. Controls should take into consideration the intrinsic
     variability of the biological material needed for ATMP manufacturing. A robust
     manufacturing process is therefore crucial and in-process controls take on a
     particular importance in the manufacture of biological active substances and
     medicinal products.


PART A: GENERAL GUIDANCE
     Part A provides alternative or supplementary provisions to respective sections in
     Part I, II and annexes of the PIC/S GMP Guide, where necessary. Where this
     annex provides specific guidance for the manufacture of ATMPs (including
     modification, replacement or redundancy of other sections), this will be clearly
     indicated. In the absence of specific guidance for ATMPs, compliance with other
     sections in the PIC/S GMP Guide is expected.

     Note: Where the term Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) is used, unless
     otherwise specified, it should be intended to signify the “Sponsor” for
     investigational ATMP that is used according to a CTA or equivalent.




PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -73-                           25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



SUPPLIMENTARY PROVISIONS TO PIC/S GMP GUIDE PART I

CHAPTER 1 PHARMACEUTICAL QUALITY SYSTEM
Pharmaceutical Quality System

1.1   ATMPs are not sold or supplied before an Authorised Person has certified that
      each production batch has been produced and controlled in accordance with the
      requirements of the CTA, MA and any other regulations relevant to the
      production, control and release of medicinal products as applicable. Special
      provisions apply for the supply of products that have a two-step release process
      (described in Section 6.14) or such that do not meet release specifications where
      there is no alternative treatment available (described in Sections 6.11 to 6.13).
      (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section 1.4, xv)

Quality Risk Management

1.2   GMP applies to the lifecycle stages from the manufacture of investigational
      ATMP, technology transfer, and commercial manufacturing through to product
      discontinuation. The biological processes may display inherent variability, so that
      the range and nature of by-products may be variable. As a result, Quality Risk
      Management (QRM) principles as detailed in Annex 20 are particularly important
      for this class of medicinal products and should be used to develop their control
      strategy across all stages of development and manufacturing steps to minimise
      variability and to reduce the opportunity for contamination and
      cross-contamination. (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section 1.2)


CHAPTER 2 PERSONNEL
2.1   The health status of personnel should be taken into consideration for product
      safety. Personnel (including those concerned with cleaning, maintenance or
      quality control) employed in areas where ATMP active substances and products
      are manufactured and tested should receive training, and periodic retraining,
      specific to the products manufactured and to the duties assigned to them,
      including any specific safety measures to protect product, personnel and the
      environment.

2.2   Any changes in the health status of personnel, which could adversely affect the
      quality of the product, should prevent work in the production area. Health
      monitoring of staff should be commensurate with the risk; medical advice should
      be sought for personnel involved with hazardous organisms. General
      consideration should be given to Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) for
      personnel involved with hazardous substances as required by national law.

2.3   Every person entering the manufacturing areas should wear clean protective
      garments appropriate to the operations to be carried out.

      Where required to minimise the opportunity for cross-contamination, restrictions
      on the movement of all personnel (including QC, maintenance and cleaning
      personnel) should be controlled based on QRM principles.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -74-                           25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



      In general, personnel should not pass from areas of exposure to live
      micro-organisms, genetically modified organisms, toxins or animals to areas
      where other products, inactivated products or different organisms are handled. If
      such route is unavoidable, a Contamination Control Strategy (CCS) based on
      QRM principles should be applied (refer to Section 3.4 CCS). (Replaces PIC/S
      GMP Guide Part I Section 2.18)

CHAPTER 3 PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

PREMISES
Production Areas

3.1   Cross-contamination should be prevented for all products by appropriate design
      and operation of manufacturing facilities. The measures to prevent cross-
      contamination should be commensurate with the risks to product quality. QRM
      principles should be used to assess and control the risks.

      Depending on the level of risk presented by some ATMPs and the materials
      involved in their production (for example, viruses), it may be necessary to
      dedicate premises and equipment for manufacturing and/or packaging operations
      to control the risk. Segregated production areas should be used for the
      manufacture of ATMPs presenting a risk that cannot be adequately controlled by
      operational and/or technical measures. (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I
      Section 3.6)

3.2   Concurrent production of two or more different ATMPs/batches in the same area
      might be permitted due to adequate operational and/or technical control where
      justified under QRM principles applied across the entire sequence of
      manufacturing steps. For example:

      (a) The use of more than one closed isolator (or other closed systems) in the
          same room at the same time is acceptable, provided that appropriate
          mitigation measures are taken to avoid cross-contamination or mix-ups of
          materials.

      (b) When more than one isolator is used to process different viral vectors within
          the same room there should be 100% air exhaustion from the room and the
          facility (i.e. no recirculation). In addition, in case of concurrent production of
          viral vectors, it is necessary to provide for closed, separate and unidirectional
          waste handling.

      (c) The possibility of using more than one biosafety cabinet (BSC) in the same
          room is only acceptable if effective technical and organisational measures
          are implemented to separate the activities. The simultaneous use of more
          than one BSC entails additional risks and, therefore, it should be
          demonstrated that the measures implemented are effective to avoid risks to
          the quality of the product and any mix-ups. The rationale should be justified
          based on QRM principles.

      (d) The use of multiple closed systems in the same area is permitted, in the case
          that their close state can be demonstrated. (refer to point 3.13.)


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -75-                            25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use




3.3   The measures and procedures necessary for containment (i.e. for environment
      and operator safety) should not conflict with those for product quality.

3.4   Special precautions should be taken in the case of manufacturing activities
      involving infectious viral vectors (e.g. oncolytic viruses, replication competent
      vectors) that should be segregated based on a documented CCS and QRM
      principles. The manufacturer should justify the level of segregation required
      based on the CCS and through QRM principles. The outcome of the QRM
      process should determine the necessity for and extent to which the premises and
      equipment should be dedicated to a particular product. In some cases, dedicated
      facilities, dedicated areas or dedicated equipment may be required in accordance
      with the national law. Simultaneous incubation and/or storage of replication
      competent vectors/products, or infected materials/products, with other
      materials/products is not acceptable.

3.5   Air handling units should be designed, constructed and maintained to minimise
      the risk of cross-contamination between different manufacturing areas and may
      need to be specific for an area. Consideration, based on QRM principles, should
      be given to the use of single pass air systems.

3.6   If materials (such as culture media and buffers) have to be measured or weighed
      during the production process, small stocks may be kept in the production area
      for a specified duration based on defined criteria (e.g. duration of manufacture of
      the batch or of the campaign). (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section 3.13)

3.7   Positive pressure areas should be used to process sterile products, but negative
      pressure in specific areas at the point of exposure of pathogens is acceptable for
      containment reasons. Where negative pressure areas or BSCs are used for
      aseptic processing of materials with particular risks (e.g. pathogens), they should
      be surrounded by a positive pressure clean zone of appropriate Grade. These
      pressure cascades should be clearly defined and continuously monitored with
      appropriate alarm settings as defined by Annex 1. The design of such areas
      should be such that measures put in place to prevent release of material into the
      surrounding environment should not compromise sterility assurance level (SAL)
      of the product and vice versa.

3.8   Air vent filters that are directly linked to the sterility of the product (e.g. to maintain
      the integrity of a closed system) should be hydrophobic, monitored during use
      (e.g. pressure differential monitoring if appropriate) and validated for their
      scheduled life span with integrity testing at appropriate intervals based on
      appropriate QRM principles. If pressure monitoring or integrity testing is
      technically not feasible for the filter system, vendor supplied information may be
      considered for approval. However, this has to be taken into account in the CCS
      as an additional risk factor especially for short shelf life ATMPs, where
      microbiological quality tests are not available at the time of batch release prior to
      medical product administration.

3.9   Drainage systems must be designed so that effluents can be effectively
      neutralised or decontaminated to minimise the risk of cross-contamination. They
      must comply with national law to minimize the risk of contamination of the external
      environment according to the risk associated with the biohazardous nature of
      waste materials. (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section 3.11)


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -76-                              25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use




3.10   The degree of environmental control of particulate and microbial contamination
       of the production premises should be adapted to the product and the production
       step, bearing in mind the potential level of contamination of the starting materials
       and the risks to the product. The microbiological environmental monitoring
       programme should be supplemented by the inclusion of methods to detect the
       presence of specific microorganisms (e.g. host organism, yeasts, moulds,
       anaerobes, etc.) where indicated by the QRM principles.

3.11   Where processes are not closed and there is exposure of the product to the
       immediate room environment without a subsequent microbial inactivation
       process, (e.g. during additions of supplements, media, buffers, gasses,
       manipulations) appropriate environmental conditions should be applied. For
       aseptic manipulations parameters in line with Annex 1 (i.e. Grade A with Grade
       B background) should be applied. The environmental monitoring program should
       include testing and monitoring of non-viable contamination, viable contamination
       and air pressure differentials. The monitoring locations should be determined
       having regards to the QRM principles. The number of samples, volume, and
       frequency of monitoring, alert and action limits should be appropriate taking into
       account the QRM principles. Sampling methods should not pose a risk of
       contamination to the manufacturing operations. Where appropriate control is
       required in the process, temperature and relative humidity should be monitored.
       All environmental monitoring results should be trended.

3.12   Only in exceptional circumstances when an appropriate manufacturing
       environment is not available, a less stringent environment than that specified in
       Section 3.11 above may be acceptable for processes that are not closed where
       approved by the Competent Authority and in accordance with CTA or MA or other
       national requirements. However, this option should be considered exceptional
       and applicable only if the product is intended to treat a life-threatening condition
       where no alternative therapeutic options exist. The environment must be
       specified and justified to provide patient benefit that outweighs the significant risk
       created by manufacturing under less stringent environments. If the Competent
       Authority grants an approval, the manufacturer must pursue establishing the
       appropriate environment as improvements in the technology occur.

3.13   For closed systems, a lower classified area than Grade A in background Grade B
       might be acceptable based on the outcome of a QRM assessment. The
       appropriate level of air classification and monitoring should be determined having
       regard to the specific risks, considering the nature of the product, the
       manufacturing process and the equipment used. QRM should be used to
       determine whether the technology used supports reduced monitoring, in
       particular where monitoring can be a source of contamination. This is in addition
       to:

           (a) The use of technologies as e.g. processing inside single use sterile
               disposable kits, or processing using closed, automated manufacturing
               platform or incubation in closed flasks, bags or fermenters in Grade C
               may be acceptable if adequate control measures are implemented to
               avoid the risk of microbial contamination and cross-contamination (e.g.
               appropriate control of materials, personnel flows and cleanliness).
               Particular attention should be paid if the materials are subsequently
               moved to a clean area of higher Grade.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -77-                            25 August 2023
          Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use




              (b) If the closed system can be shown to remain integral throughout the
                  entire usage, a background of Grade D might be acceptable.

         Requirements of Annex 1 regarding the provision of closed system should be
         considered.

3.14     In exceptional circumstances, it is permissible to perform a manufacturing step in
         premises that are not under direct control of the ATMP manufacturer or MAH
         (including for example placing equipment used to perform manufacturing steps in
         hospital wards or theatre) where approved by the Competent Authority and in
         accordance with CTA or MA or other national requirements. In such cases, it
         should be demonstrated that the process maintains its validated status in
         accordance to principles and guidelines in Annex 15, Annex 20 and in this annex.
         These arrangements should be subject to approval by the Competent Authority.
         The responsibilities of each parties should be defined in written technical
         agreements.


EQUIPMENT
3.15     Production equipment should not present any hazard to the products. The parts
         of the production equipment that come into contact with the product must not be
         reactive, additive or absorptive to such an extent that it will affect the quality of
         the product and thus present any hazard.

         In addition, if single use systems (i.e. disposable systems) are used, the
         manufacturer should take into account and verify the impact on the product from
         extractable, leachable, insoluble particulate and insoluble matter derived from
         such systems. Annex 1 regarding provisions for single use systems should be
         considered. (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section 3.39)

3.16     Where required to minimise the risk of cross-contamination, restrictions on the
         movement of equipment should be applied. In general, equipment should not be
         moved from high-risk areas to other areas, or between high-risk areas (e.g.
         equipment used for the handling of cells from infected donors or the handling of
         oncolytic viruses). Where the relocation of equipment is unavoidable, after
         reviewing engineering and/ or technical modifications, the risk should be
         assessed in line with QRM principles, mitigated and monitored to ensure an
         effective cross-contamination control strategy (refer to Section 3.4 CCS). The
         qualification status of the equipment moved should also be considered.

3.17     The design of equipment used during handling of live organisms and cells,
         including those for sampling, should be considered to prevent any contamination
         during processing.

3.18     Primary containment4 should be designed and periodically tested to ensure the
         prevention of escape of biological agents into the immediate working
         environment.

    PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -78-                            25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



3.19   Electronic systems used to support manufacturing must be qualified in
       accordance with Annex 11 and 15. Any analytical testing performed on materials
       not used in manufacturing but that support bioinformatics informing the
       manufacturing process (e.g. patient gene sequencing) should be validated. Such
       analytical equipment is expected to be qualified prior to use.

CHAPTER 4 DOCUMENTATION
Specifications

4.1    Specifications for ATMP starting and raw materials may need additional
       documentation on the source, origin, distribution chain, method of manufacture,
       and controls applied, to assure an appropriate level of control and oversight
       including their microbiological quality.

4.2    Some products may require specific definition of what materials constitute a
       batch. For autologous and donor-matched situations, the manufactured product
       should be viewed as a batch.

Traceability

4.3    Where human cells or tissues are used, full traceability is required from starting
       and raw materials, including all substances coming into contact with the cells or
       tissues through to confirmation of the receipt of the products at the point of use
       whilst maintaining the privacy of individuals and confidentiality of health-related
       information, according to national legislation.

4.4    For starting materials of human origin, the identification of the supplier and the
       anatomical environment from which the cells/tissues/virus originates (or, as
       appropriate, the identification of the cell-line, master cell bank, seed lot) should
       also be described.

4.5    A system that enables the bidirectional tracking of cells/tissues contained in
       ATMPs from the point of donation, through manufacturing, to the delivery of the
       finished product to the recipient should be created. This system can be manual
       or automated. It should be used throughout the manufacturing lifecycle to include
       clinical trial and commercial batches.

4.6    Traceability records should be kept as an auditable document and unequivocally
       linked to the relevant batch record. The storage system should ensure that
       traceability data allow for easy access, in case of an adverse reaction from the
       patient.

4.7    Traceability records for cellular and tissue-based products and for any
       personalized ATMP must be retained 30 years after the expiry date of the product
       unless otherwise specified in the MA/CTA or national law. Particular care should
       be taken to maintain the traceability of products for special use cases, such as
       donor-matched cells. National requirements applied to blood components in
       regard to traceability requirements and notification of serious adverse reactions
       and events apply to blood components when they are used as starting or raw
       materials in the manufacturing process of medicinal products. Human cells




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -79-                           25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



      including haematopoietic cells must comply with the principles laid down in
      national law concerning traceability.

4.8   When xenogeneic cells are used as starting materials for ATMPs, information
      permitting the identification of the donor animal should be kept for 30 years unless
      otherwise specified in the MA/CTA or national legislation.

CHAPTER 5 PRODUCTION
General

5.1   ATMPs must comply with the applicable national requirements on minimising the
      risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and
      veterinary medicinal products.

      Viral safety for gene therapy ATMPs should be ensured by having systems in
      place that ensure the quality of starting (including cell banks and viral seed
      stocks) and raw materials through the production process.

5.2   The conditions for sample collection, additions and transfers involving replication
      competent vectors or materials from infected donors should prevent the release
      of viral/infected material.

5.3   At every stage of processing, materials and products should be protected from
      microbial and any other contamination. Appropriate contamination control and
      monitoring strategies should be implemented (refer to Section 3.4 CCS).
      Particular consideration should be given to the risk of cross-contamination
      between cell preparations from different donors and, where applicable, from
      donors having different positive serological markers. (Replaces PIC/S GMP
      Guide Part I Section 5.10)

5.4   The use of antimicrobials may be necessary to reduce bioburden associated with
      the procurement of living tissues and cells. However, the use of antimicrobials
      does not replace the requirement for aseptic manufacturing. When antimicrobials
      are used, their use should be recorded; they should be removed as soon as
      possible, unless the presence thereof in the finished product is specifically
      foreseen in the CTA or MA (e.g. antibiotics that are part of the matrix of the
      finished product). Additionally, it is important to ensure that antimicrobials do not
      interfere with any product microbial contamination testing or sterility testing, and
      that they are not present in the finished product (unless specifically justified in the
      CTA or MA).

5.5   Labels applied to containers, equipment or premises should be clear, well defined
      and in the manufacturer’s agreed format.

      Care should be taken in the preparation, printing, storage and application of
      labels, including any specific text for patient-specific or autologous product. For
      products containing cells derived from human cells or tissue, donor’s labels
      should contain all relevant information that is needed to provide full traceability.
      In the case of autologous products, the unique patient identifier and the statement
      “for autologous use only” should be indicated on the outer packaging or, where




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -80-                             25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



       there is no outer packaging, on the immediate packaging or as otherwise
       specified in national law.

       Alternative approaches/measures are permitted as long as the risk of erroneous
       administration of the product is adequately mitigated. For investigational ATMPs
       that are blinded, the requirement to state “autologous use” can be substituted by
       a barcode or an alternative equivalent mechanism that ensures blinding while
       maintaining patient safety. (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section 5.13)

5.6    When setting up a programme for primary and secondary packaging operations,
       particular attention should be given to minimising the risk of cross-contamination,
       mix-ups or substitutions. Sterility and/or low bioburden requirements should be
       adhered to and segregation strategies should be applied. (Replaces PIC/S GMP
       Guide Part I Section 5.49)

5.7    If closed systems are used for the production of ATMPs, checks should be carried
       out to ensure that all pieces of the equipment are connected in a correct manner
       to assure the closed state. Special attention should be given to apply these tests
       to automated systems. If feasible and based on QRM principles, for example
       considering testing carried out by vendors, the integrity of single use systems
       should be verified at adequate frequency prior to use and potentially post use,
       possibly automatically. The integrity of reused equipment should be verified
       before use after cleaning and sterilisation.

5.8    A system is no longer considered closed when materials are added or withdrawn
       without aseptic techniques (e.g. without use of sterile connectors or filters
       aseptically connected).

5.9    Where chromatography equipment is used, a suitable control strategy for
       matrices, the housings and associated equipment (adapted to the risks) should
       be implemented when used in campaign manufacture and in multi-product
       environments. The re-use of the same matrix at different stages of processing is
       discouraged due to risk of carryover contamination. Any such re-usage should be
       supported by appropriate validation data. Acceptance criteria, operating
       conditions, regeneration methods, life span, and sanitization or sterilisation
       methods of chromatography columns should be defined.

5.10   Careful attention should be paid to specific requirements at any cryopreservation
       stages, e.g. the rate of temperature change during freezing or thawing. The type
       of storage chamber, placement and retrieval process should minimise the risk of
       cross-contamination, maintain the quality of the products and facilitate their
       accurate retrieval. Documented procedures should be in place for the secure
       handling and storage of products with positive serological markers.

5.11   The suitability of selected packaging material should be considered. The
       adhesiveness, durability and legibility of printed text of labels used for containers
       that are stored at ultra-low temperatures (- 60 °C or lower) should be verified.
       Additionally, apply a holistic approach to minimize the risk to container closure
       integrity (CCI) that can occur during storage at ultra-low temperatures. Evidence‐
       based data should be generated to support the selection of the appropriate
       primary packaging components and qualification of the container/closure sealing
       process.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -81-                            25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



Prevention of Cross-contamination in Production

5.12   An evidence-based QRM process should be used to assess and control the
       cross-contamination risks presented by the products manufactured. Factors to
       take into account include:

       (a) vectors used and the risk of occurrence of replication competent virus
           (including different level of risk derived from the use of replication limited,
           replication defective, conditional replication and replication incompetent
           vectors),

       (b) facility/equipment design and use,

       (c) personnel and material flow,

       (d) microbiological and other adventitious agent controls,

       (e) characteristics of the starting materials/active substance and raw materials,

       (f) process characteristics,

       (g) clean room conditions,

       (h) cleaning processes, and

       (i) analytical capabilities relative to the relevant limits established from the
           evaluation of the products.

       The outcome of the QRM process should be the basis for determining the process
       workflow and necessity for and extent to which premises and equipment should
       be dedicated or single use systems should be used for a particular product. This
       may include dedicating specific product contact parts or dedication of the entire
       manufacturing facility. It may be acceptable to confine manufacturing activities to
       a segregated, self-contained production area within a multiproduct facility, where
       justified. Results should be reviewed jointly with the CCS.
       (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section 5.20)

5.13   The methods used for sterilisation, disinfection, virus removal or inactivation
       should be validated. In cases where a virus inactivation or removal process is
       performed during manufacture, measures to avoid the risk of recontamination
       should be taken. (refer to Section 5.19(a))

5.14   An emergency plan for dealing with accidental release of viable organisms should
       be in place. This should address methods and procedures for containment,
       protection of operators, cleaning, decontamination and safe return to use.
       Accidental spillages, especially of live organisms, must be dealt with quickly and
       safely. Decontamination measures should be available for each organism or
       groups of related organisms in line with the QRM process. Decontamination
       measures should be validated for effectiveness.

5.15   If obviously contaminated, such as by spills or aerosols, or if a potential
       hazardous organism is involved, production and control materials, including


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -82-                           25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



       paperwork, must be adequately disinfected, or the information transferred out by
       other means. An assessment of the impact on the immediate products and any
       others in the affected area should also be made.

5.16   The risks of cross-contamination should be assessed having regard to the
       characteristics of the product (e.g. biological characteristics of the starting
       materials, possibility to withstand purification techniques) and manufacturing
       process (e.g. the use of processes that provide extraneous microbial
       contaminants the opportunity to grow). For ATMPs that cannot be sterilised, any
       open processing (e.g. filling) must be conducted aseptically to minimise the
       introduction of contaminants.

5.17   In all manufacturing steps that may lead to unwanted formation of aerosols (e.g.
       centrifugation, working under vacuum, homogenisation, and sonication)
       appropriate mitigation measures should be implemented to avoid cross-
       contamination. Special precautions should be taken when working with infectious
       materials.

5.18   Measures to prevent cross-contamination appropriate to the risks identified
       should be put in place. Measures that can be considered to prevent cross-
       contamination include, among others:

       (a) segregated premises,

       (b) dedicating the entire manufacturing facility or a self-contained production
           area on a campaign basis (separation in time) followed by a cleaning process
           of validated effectiveness,

       (c) adequate cleaning procedures:

               i.   the cleaning procedure (technique, number of sanitation steps, etc.)
                    should be adapted to the specific characteristics of the product and
                    of the manufacturing process;

              ii.   a risk-assessment should be used to determine the cleaning and
                    decontamination procedures that are necessary, including the
                    frequency thereof;

             iii.   as a minimum, there should be appropriate cleaning and
                    decontamination between each batch; and

             iv.    all cleaning and decontamination procedures should be validated.

       (d) use of “closed systems” for processing and for material or product transfer
           between individual processing equipment,

       (e) use of air locks and pressure cascade to confine potential airborne
           contaminant within a specified area,

       (f) utilisation of single use systems,

       (g) other suitable organisational measures, such as the:




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -83-                          25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



               i.    dedication of certain parts of equipment (e.g. filters) to a given type
                     of product with a specific risk profile;

              ii.    keeping specific protective clothing inside areas where products with
                     high-risk of contamination are processed;

              iii.   implementing adequate measures to handling waste, contaminated
                     rinsing water and soiled gowning; and

              iv.    imposing restrictions on the movement of personnel.
             (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section 5.21)

Validation

5.19   During process validation potential limited availability of quantities of tissue/cells
       has to be taken into account. A strategy on gaining maximum process knowledge
       has to be implemented.

       Validation studies should be conducted in accordance with defined procedures.
       Results and conclusions should be recorded, in particular:

       (a) ATMPs manufactured for exploratory, early phase clinical trials (phase I and
           phase I/II), are expected to be validated proportionately with the knowledge
           and the risk associated with the respective phase. All aseptic and sterilisation
           processes as well as virus inactivation or removal for investigational and
           authorised ATMPs are expected to be validated. The effectiveness of
           disinfection methods should be proven. For all phases, the principles as
           outlined in Annex 13 should be applied.

       (b) For all aseptic processes, aseptic process simulations should be performed
           as part of initial validation and repeated thereafter every six months in line
           with Annex 1. In the case of infrequent production (i.e. if the interval between
           the production of two batches is more than six months but less than a year),
           it is acceptable that the process simulation test is done prior to manufacturing
           of the next batch. This is provided that, the results of the process simulation
           test are available prior to the starting of production. Any deviation from this
           approach needs to be thoroughly justified by QRM principles considering all
           aspects of product nature, product quality and patient safety.

       (c) If the ATMP is not produced on a routine basis (i.e. over a year), the aseptic
           process simulation should be conducted at least in triplicate prior to the start
           of manufacturing, involving all relevant operators. QRM principles should be
           applied in accordance with Annex 1. Any deviation from this approach needs
           to be thoroughly justified by QRM principles considering all aspects of product
           nature, product quality and patient safety.

       (d) The use of surrogate material during process validation may be acceptable
           when there is shortage of the starting materials (e.g. autologous ATMPs,
           allogeneic in a matched-donor scenario, allogeneic where there is no
           expansion of cells to MCB). The representativeness of surrogate starting
           material should be evaluated, including – for example – donor age, use of
           materials from healthy donors, anatomical source (e.g. femur vs. iliac crest)



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -84-                            25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



           or other different characteristics (e.g. use of representative cell-types or use
           of cells at a higher passage number than that foreseen in the product
           specifications).

       (e) Where possible, consideration should be given to complementing the use of
           surrogate materials with samples from the actual starting materials for key
           aspects of the manufacturing process. For instance, in the case of an ATMP
           based on modification of autologous cells to treat a genetic disorder, process
           validation using the autologous cells (affected by the condition) may be
           limited to those parts of the process that focus on the genetic modification
           itself. Other aspects could be validated using a representative surrogate cell
           type.
       (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section 5.23)

Control of different types of materials including ATMP Active Substances

5.20   For the approval and maintenance of suppliers of materials, the following is
       required:

       ATMP Active substances

       The supply chain traceability should be established. Associated risks, from active
       substance starting materials to the finished medicinal product, should be formally
       assessed and periodically verified. Appropriate measures should be put in place
       to reduce risks to the quality of the active substance.

       The supply chain and traceability records for each active substance should be
       available and be retained by the manufacturer of the ATMP.

       Raw materials and process aids

       Prior to setting up the manufacturing process and whenever a change of the
       respective material is implemented, a QRM process should assess the risk of
       contamination from the relevant materials as well as their influence on the entire
       manufacturing process and the resulting product. Appropriate measures should
       be put in place to reduce risks to the quality of the materials.

       Material directly in contact with the ATMP during manufacture and storage

       All materials that come in direct contact with the ATMP should be of appropriate
       quality. The risk of microbiological contamination should be assessed especially
       for single use systems.
       (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section 5.29)

5.21   Only materials that have been released by the Quality Unit and that are within
       their expiration or retest date should be used. Where the results of necessary
       tests are not available, it may be permissible to process materials before the
       results of the tests are available, the risk of using a potentially failed material and
       its potential impact on other batches should be clearly described and assessed
       under the principles of QRM. In such cases, release of a finished product is




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -85-                             25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



       conditional on satisfactory results of these tests. (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide
       Part I Section 5.34)

5.22   A regular qualification of the vendors (e.g. manufacturers and distributors) of all
       materials to confirm that they comply with the relevant GMP requirements should
       be performed. Whether an on-site audit needs to be performed at a
       manufacturer’s or distributor’s premises should be defined based on QRM
       principles. Generally, audits need to be performed at vendors of all materials
       defined as critical for the manufacturing process according to its product risk
       profile (PRP). Refer to provisions detailed in Chapter 7 as modified by this annex.

5.23   Application of QRM principles to the total supply chain is a critical part of the
       process to understand the risks to material quality. The principles of quality by
       design (QbD) as described in ICH Q8 Guideline on Pharmaceutical Development
       could be applied:

       (a) The MAH should define what constitutes ATMP active substances, starting
           materials, raw materials and other materials such as single use systems,
           primary packaging materials and any other materials in direct contact with the
           product during manufacture by means of Product Risk Profiles (PRP). The
           PRP should be used to justify the levels of control that apply to individual
           materials.

       (b) Establish the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and define the Critical
           Quality Attributes (CQA) and the Critical Process Parameters (CPP) for the
           ATMP to establish PRP appropriately.

       (c) For each material used, identify the risks presented to the quality, safety and
           function from its source through to its incorporation in the finished product
           dosage form. Areas for consideration should include, but are not limited to:

                i.   transmissible spongiform encephalopathy;

                ii. potential for viral contamination;

                iii. potential for microbiological or endotoxin/pyrogen contamination;

                iv. potential, in general, for any impurity originating from the raw
                    materials, or generated as part of the process and carried over;

                v. sterility assurance for materials claimed to be sterile;

                vi. potential for any impurities carried over from other processes, in
                    absence of dedicated equipment and/or facilities;

                vii. environmental control and storage/transportation          conditions
                     including cold chain management; if appropriate and

                viii. stability.

       (d) With respect to the use and function of each material, consider the following:




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -86-                           25 August 2023
      Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



              i.   pharmaceutical form and use of the medicinal product containing the
                   material;

              ii. function of the material in the formulation, and for gene therapy
                  products the impact on the gene expression of that material;

              iii. degree of which the function of the final product is dependent from
                   the material assessed and how likely it is to be controlled further into
                   the manufacturing process (i.e. if the gene sequence is wrong how
                   easily can this be detected and corrected or if the product is
                   contaminated how likely can this be detected or corrected later in the
                   manufacturing process);

              iv. time of preparation of the material in respect to the time of
                  administration of the final product;

              v. quantity of material with particular reference to the implication of
                 small final product batch sizes (e.g. 5-50 mg);

              vi. any known quality defects/fraudulent adulterations, both globally and
                  at a local company level related to the material;

              vii. known or potential impact on the CQA and CPP of the ATMP; and

              viii. other factors as identified or known to be relevant to assuring patient
                    safety.

      (e) Document the risk profile as low, medium, or high based on the above
          assessment and use this outcome to determine the PRP. On this basis, the
          MAH should establish and document the elements of PIC/S GMP that are
          needed to be in place in order to control and maintain the QTPP.

      (f) Once the PRP and the appropriate GMP have been defined, ongoing risk
          review should be performed through mechanisms such as:

              i.   number of defects connected to batches of respective material
                   received;

              ii. type/severity of such defects;

              iii. monitoring and trend analysis of material quality;

              iv. observation of trends in drug product quality attributes; this will
                  depend on the nature and role of material; and

              v. observed organisational, procedural or technical/process changes at
                 the material manufacturer.

      (g) Incorporate the PRP into the CTA or MA as applicable.

      (h) The QTPP, once approved in the production process by the Competent
          Authority, should guide the manufacturer through what controls are important
          and expected and which can be exempted. The manufacturer should have a


PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -87-                             25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



           control strategy established that justifies the level of testing performed for
           incoming starting materials.

5.24   Particular attention should be paid to avoiding contamination and to minimising
       the variability of the materials. Specifications related to the product (such as those
       in pharmacopoeial monographs, CTA, or MA), will dictate whether and to what
       stage substances and materials can have a defined level of bioburden or need to
       be sterile.

5.25   For products where final sterilisation is not possible and the ability to remove
       microbial by-products is limited, the controls required for the quality of materials
       and on the aseptic manufacturing process assume greater importance. Where a
       CTA or MA provides for an allowable type and level of bioburden, for example at
       the ATMP active substance stage, the control strategy should address the means
       by which this is maintained within the specified limits.

5.26   The selection, qualification, approval and maintenance of suppliers of starting
       materials, raw materials and materials that come in direct contact with the
       products during manufacture and storage (e.g. single use systems) together with
       their purchase and acceptance should be documented as part of the
       pharmaceutical quality system. The level of oversight should be proportionate to
       the risks posed by the individual materials taking account of their source,
       manufacturing process, supply chain complexity and the final use to which the
       material is put in the ATMP. The supporting evidence for each supplier / material
       approval should be maintained. Personnel involved in these activities should
       have a current knowledge of the suppliers, the supply chain and the associated
       risks involved. Where possible, these materials should be purchased directly from
       the manufacturer or a manufacturer approved supplier. (Replaces PIC/S GMP
       Guide Part I Section 5.27)

5.27   For starting material of human origin, the agreement between the ATMP
       manufacturer (or, as appropriate, the MAH) and the supplier (including blood and
       tissue establishments) should contain clear provisions about the transfer of
       information. In particular, this should include test results performed by the
       supplier, traceability data, and transmission of health donor information that may
       become available after the supply that may have an impact on the quality or
       safety of the ATMPs manufactured. National laws that are required as part of the
       donation and procurement of human blood and blood components,
       haematopoietic progenitor cells, human tissues and cells for manufacturing
       purposes need to be adhered to. (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section
       5.28)

5.28   The quality requirements established by the manufacturer in the MA or CTA for
       materials classified as critical during QRM process (according to PRP profile)
       should be discussed and agreed with the suppliers during the product life cycle.
       Appropriate aspects of the production, testing and control, including handling,
       labelling, packaging and distribution requirements, complaints, recalls and
       rejection procedures should be documented in a formal quality agreement.

       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



Human Blood, Tissues and Cells Used as Starting Materials

5.29   The donation, procurement and testing of human blood, tissues and cells used
       as starting materials for ATMPs should be in accordance with the applicable
       national law.

       (a)   The procurement, donation and testing of blood, cells and tissues is
             regulated in some countries. Such supply sites must hold appropriate
             approvals from the Competent Authority(ies) which should be verified as
             part of supplier management.

       (b)   For cell therapies, the maintenance of the aseptic processing from time of
             procurement of cells through manufacturing and administration back into
             the patient should be ensured.

       (c)   Where such human cells or tissues are imported, they must meet
             equivalent national standards of quality and safety. The traceability and
             serious adverse reaction and serious adverse event notification
             requirements may be set out in national law.

       (d)   There may be some instances where processing of blood, tissues and cells
             used as starting materials for ATMPs will be conducted at blood or tissue
             establishments. This is permissible only if authorised by national law (e.g.
             the material would be otherwise compromised and processing involves only
             minimal manipulation).

       (e)   Blood, tissue and cells are released by the Responsible Person (RP) in the
             blood or tissue establishment before shipment to the ATMP manufacturer.
             After that, normal medicinal product starting material controls apply. The
             test results of all tissues / cells supplied by the tissue establishment should
             be available to the manufacturer of the medicinal product. Such information
             must be used to make appropriate material segregation and storage
             decisions. In cases where manufacturing must be initiated prior to receiving
             test results from the tissue establishment, tissue and cells may be shipped
             to the medicinal product manufacturer, provided controls are in place to
             prevent cross-contamination with tissue and cells that have been released
             by the RP in the tissue establishment.

       (f)   A technical agreement clearly defining the responsibilities should be in
             place between all involved parties (e.g. manufacturers, tissue
             establishment, sponsors, MAH).

       (g)   The transport of blood, tissues and cells to the manufacturing site must be
             controlled by a written agreement between the responsible parties. The
             manufacturing sites should have documentary evidence of adherence to
             the specified storage and transport conditions.

       (h)   Continuation of traceability requirements started at tissue establishments
             through to the recipient(s), and vice versa, including materials in contact
             with the cells or tissues should be maintained.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -89-                            25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



Seed Lot and Cell Bank System

5.30   A system of master and working virus seed lots and/or cell banks is
       recommended if the production of allogeneic ATMP involves cell culture or
       propagation in embryos and animals. This can prevent the unwanted drift of
       properties, which might ensue from repeated subcultures or multiple generations.

5.31   The number of generations (doublings, passages) between the seed lot or cell
       bank, the active substance and finished product should be consistent with
       specifications in the MA or CTA.

5.32   As part of product lifecycle management, establishment of seed lots and cell
       banks, including master and working generations, as well as maintenance and
       storage, should be performed under appropriate GMP conditions. This should
       include an appropriately controlled environment to protect the seed lot and the
       cell bank and the personnel handling it. During the establishment of the seed lot
       and cell bank, no other living or infectious material (e.g. virus, cell lines or cell
       strains) should be handled simultaneously in the same area or by the same
       persons. For all stages prior to the establishment of the master seed or cell bank
       generation, principles of GMP may be applied. For all pre-master bank stages,
       documentation should be available to support traceability. All issues related to
       components used during the development with potential impact on product safety
       (e.g. reagents of biological origin) from initial sourcing and genetic development
       should be documented.

5.33   Following the establishment of master and working cell banks and master and
       working seed lots, quarantine and release procedures should be followed. This
       should include adequate characterisation and testing for contaminants. Their
       on-going suitability for use should be further demonstrated by the consistency of
       the characteristics and quality of the successive batches of product. Evidence of
       the stability and recovery of the seeds and banks should be documented and
       records should be kept in a manner permitting trend evaluation.

5.34   Seed lots and cell banks should be stored and used in such a way as to minimise
       the risks of contamination (e.g. stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen in
       sealed containers) or alteration. Control measures for the storage of different
       seeds and/or cells in the same area or equipment should prevent mix-up and take
       into account the infectious nature of the materials to prevent cross-contamination.

5.35   Cell based ATMPs are often generated from a cell stock obtained from limited
       number of passages. In contrast with the two-tiered system of Master and
       Working cell banks, the number of production runs from a cell stock is limited by
       the number of aliquots obtained after expansion and does not cover the entire life
       cycle of the product. Cell stock changes should be addressed in the MA/CTA and
       thereby covered by a validation and comparability protocol, as the inter-donor
       variability may change the product.

5.36   Storage containers should be sealed, clearly labelled and kept at an appropriate
       temperature. A stock inventory must be kept. The storage temperature and,
       where used, the liquid nitrogen levels should be continuously monitored.
       Deviation from set limits and corrective and preventive action taken should be
       recorded.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -90-                            25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



5.37   It is desirable to split stocks and to store the split stocks at different locations to
       minimise the risks of total loss. The controls at such locations should provide the
       assurances outlined in the preceding paragraphs.

5.38   The storage and handling conditions for stocks should be managed according to
       the same procedures and parameters. Once containers are removed from the
       seed lot / cell bank management system, the containers should not be returned
       to stock.

CHAPTER 6 QUALITY CONTROL
6.1    In-process controls have a greater importance in ensuring the consistency of the
       quality of ATMPs than for conventional products. In-process control testing
       should be performed at appropriate stages of production to control those
       conditions that are important for the quality of the finished product.

General

6.2    The head of quality control is responsible for control of ATMP active substances,
       starting materials, raw materials and other materials such as primary packaging
       materials and any other material in direct contact with the product during
       manufacture as well as medical devices that are used in combined ATMPs.
       Further, the head of quality control is responsible to control the quality of the
       ATMP throughout all stages of manufacture. In case of autologous products or
       allogeneic products in a donor-matched scenario, the match between the origin
       of the starting material and the recipient should be verified.

6.3    Samples should be representative of the batch of materials or products from
       which they are taken. Other samples may also be taken to monitor the worst-case
       part of a process (e.g. beginning or end of a process). The sampling plan used
       should be appropriately justified and based on a risk management approach.
       Certain types of cells (e.g. autologous cells used in ATMPs) may be available in
       limited quantities and, where allowed in the CTA or MA, a modified testing and
       sample retention strategy may be developed and documented. (Replaces PIC/S
       GMP Guide Part I Section 6.12)

6.4    Sample containers should bear a label indicating the contents, with the batch
       number, the date of sampling and the containers from which samples have been
       drawn. They should be managed in a manner to minimize the risk of mix-up and
       to protect the samples from adverse storage conditions. When containers are too
       small, the use of a qualified bar code or other means that permit access to this
       information should be considered. (Replaces PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Section
       6.13)

6.5    In line with requirements of Annex 19, a reference sample of a batch of starting
       material, raw materials, packaging material and finished product should be
       drawn. As a general principle, a reference sample should be of sufficient size to
       permit the carrying out on at least two occasions of the full analytical controls on
       the batch foreseen in the CTA or MA. In case of a continuous process, where the
       ATMP active substance will immediately be turned into the ATMP drug product,
       only a reference sample of the ATMP drug product needs to be drawn. However,
       it is acknowledged that drawing reference samples may not always be feasible



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -91-                             25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



      due to scarcity of the materials or limited size of the batches (e.g. autologous
      products, allogeneic products in a matched donor scenario, products for ultra-
      rare diseases, and products for use in first-in-man clinical trials with a very small-
      scale production). In these cases, alternative approaches should be justified and
      authorised in the corresponding CTA/MA.

6.6   Samples of the starting materials should generally be kept for two years after the
      batch release. However, it is acknowledged that the retention of samples may be
      challenging due to scarcity of the materials. Due to this intrinsic limitation, it is
      justified not to keep reference samples of the cells/tissues used as starting
      materials in the case of autologous ATMPs and certain allogeneic ATMPs (i.e.
      matched donor scenario). In other cases, where the scarcity of the materials is
      also a concern, the sampling strategy may be adapted based on risk assessment
      and appropriately implemented mitigation measures. For cases where the
      starting material is an established cell bank system, there is no need to keep cell
      bank vials specifically for the purpose of reference samples.

6.7   In line with requirements of Annex 19, a sample of a fully packaged unit (retention
      sample) should be kept per batch for at least one year after the expiry date
      (national requirements might differ). A retention sample is, however, not expected
      in the case of autologous products or allogeneic products, where justified (e.g. in
      a matched donor scenario), as the unit produced with the patient’s tissues/cells
      constitutes what should be administered to the patient. When it is not possible to
      keep a retention sample, photographs or copies of the label are acceptable for
      inclusion in the batch records.

6.8   Shorter retention periods as mentioned in Section 6.6 and 6.7 might be justified
      based on the stability and shelf life of the product. In cases of short shelf life, the
      manufacturer should consider if the retention of the sample under conditions that
      prolong the shelf life (such as cryopreservation) is representative for the intended
      purpose. For instance, cryopreservation of fresh-cells may render the sample
      inadequate for characterisation purposes but the sample may be adequate for
      sterility or viral safety controls (the volume of the samples can be reduced
      according to the intended purpose). When cryostorage of a sample is considered
      inadequate for the intended purpose, the manufacturer should consider
      alternative approaches that are scientifically justified.

On-going stability programme

6.9   The protocol for the on-going stability programme can be different from that of the
      initial long term stability study as submitted in the MA dossier provided that this
      is justified and documented in the protocol (e.g. the frequency of testing, or when
      updating to ICH/VICH recommendations). Stability studies on the reconstituted
      and thawed product are performed during product development and need not be
      monitored on an on-going basis. The use of surrogate materials (i.e. material
      derived from healthy volunteers) or alternative scientifically sounds approaches
      are acceptable in case of autologous products (or matched donor scenario)
      where the entire batch needs to be administered to the patient. (Replaces PIC/S
      GMP Guide Part I Section 6.31)

       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



Release

6.10   In general, batches of ATMPs should only be released for sale or supply to the
       market after certification by an Authorised Person. The batch release
       specifications are not limited to analytical results (also refer to out of specification
       (OOS) results). In line with PIC/S GMP Guide Part I Sections 1.4 (xv), 2.6. and
       6.34 the Authorised Person should assess the quality of each batch considering
       processing records, results from environmental monitoring, monitoring of process
       parameters, analytical results and all deviations from standard procedures and
       protocols. Until a batch is certified, it should remain at the site of manufacture or
       be shipped under quarantine to another site, which has been approved for that
       purpose by the relevant Competent Authority (if applicable) and is controlled
       appropriately within the manufacturer’s quality system. Generally, a finished
       product that does not meet release specifications should not be administered to
       a patient unless otherwise justified.

6.11   Where authorised by national law, the administration of a product that does not
       meet the release specification might be performed under exceptional
       circumstances (such as when there is no alternative treatment available that
       would provide the same therapeutic outcome and the administration of the failed
       products could be lifesaving).

6.12   In cases, referred to in point 6.11, where product does not meet release
       specification, the responsibility and the decision of the patient treatment are solely
       of the treating physician and are beyond the remit of this PIC/S annex. The
       Authorised Person, the MAH and/or the Sponsor of the clinical trial should
       consider the following in making the product available:

       The treating physician should provide in writing a rationale and/or request to the
       Authorised Person and MAH.

       (a) Batch manufacturing records and documentation provided to the treating
           physician should clearly state that the batch has failed the release
           specifications and describe the parameters that have not been met.

       (b) When responding to a treating physician’s request, the MAH should provide
           its evaluation of the risks of product administration. However, it is solely the
           physician’s decision to administer the finished product that does not meet
           release specifications.

       (c) The Authorised Person (or delegate) should report the supply of the product
           to the relevant Competent Authorities, on behalf of the MAH in accordance
           with their legal obligations.

6.13   The clinical trial Sponsor or MAH should have procedures in place that describe
       steps to be taken if product does not meet release specification but may be
       released to permit treatment. Individual instances that do not meet release
       specifications may be addressed through lot-by-lot release programmes and
       specific case-by-case, risk-based assessments, where such programs exist
       within national law.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -93-                            25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



6.14   For ATMPs with a short shelf life, where established analytical tests might not
       permit batch certification prior to product administration, alternative methods of
       obtaining equivalent data should be considered (e.g. rapid microbiological
       methods).

       Subject to approval from the Competent Authority, batch certification of short
       shelf life products performed prior to completion of all product quality control is
       permitted when the testing timelines would not allow for effective distribution to a
       patient.

       (a) A suitable control strategy must be in place, built on enhanced understanding
           of the product and process performance. This must take into account the
           controls and attributes of starting materials, raw materials and intermediates.

       (b) The procedure for batch certification should provide an exact and detailed
           description of the entire release procedure, including responsibilities of the
           different personnel involved in assessment of production and analytical data.

       (c) The procedure for batch certification and release of short shelf life ATMP
           may be carried out in two or more stages:

            i.    Assessment by designated person(s) of batch processing records,
                  results from environmental monitoring (where available) which should
                  cover production conditions, all deviations from standard procedures
                  and protocols as well as the available analytical results for review in
                  preparation for the initial certification by the Authorised Person.

            ii.   Assessment of the final analytical tests and other information available
                  for final certification by the Authorised Person. A procedure should be
                  in place to describe the measures to be taken (including liaison with
                  clinical staff) where out of specification test results are obtained. Such
                  events should be fully investigated and the relevant corrective and
                  preventive actions taken to prevent recurrence.

       (d) Increased reliance on process validation should be considered as supporting
           data for batch release in absence of a complete analytical results panel, even
           in case of investigational ATMP.

       (e) A continuous assessment of the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical quality
           system must be in place. This includes the records being kept in a manner,
           which permits trend evaluation.

        Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



Batch release process in cases of decentralised / point of care
manufacturing

6.15    In the exceptional circumstances where approved by the Competent Authority
        and in accordance with CTA or MA or other national requirements, manufacturing
        of the ATMP may take place in sites close to the patient (e.g. ATMPs with short
        shelf life, clinical advantage of using fresh cells as opposed to freezing the
        starting materials/finished product, advantages of using automated equipment,
        etc.). This includes manufacturing models where partial manufacturing occurs at
        a central site and finishing occurs at a local site. It also includes manufacturing
        models where there are no steps occurring at a central site and the active
        substance is provided to a number of local sites where full manufacture occurs.
        In such cases, steps in the manufacturing of the ATMPs may occur in multiple
        sites that may be also located in treatment centres (point of care) including
        hospitals. National law might require GMP-manufacturing authorisations and/ or
        authorisations for the procurement and/or manufacture of blood, cells and tissues
        intended to be used for ATMP manufacturing at the central site and the satellite
        sites.

6.16    The batch certification and release process becomes particularly important in the
        case of ATMPs manufactured under a decentralised system as manufacturing in
        multiple sites increases the risk of variability for the product. In particular, through
        the batch certification and release process it must be ensured that each batch
        released at any of the sites has been manufactured and quality controlled in
        accordance with the requirements of the CTA or MA and other relevant regulatory
        requirements including compliance with GMP. The steps of the batch certification
        and release process should be clearly documented in a standard operating
        procedure (SOP). The following conditions need to be respected:

       (a) A "responsible site", should be identified. The responsible site is responsible
           for the oversight of the decentralised sites. During the product life cycle, the
           responsible site:

              i.   must have availability of an Authorised Person;

              ii. must ensure that those involved in the batch certification and release
                  process are adequately qualified and trained for their tasks;

              iii. should perform audits to confirm compliance with the batch certification
                   and release process (as descripted in SOP);

              iv. must ensure that there is a written contract/technical agreement
                  between the responsible site and the decentralised sites establishing
                  the responsibilities of each party, and

              v. must ensure that there are written arrangements to:

                    timely report quality defects, deviations or non-conformity to the
                     central site;

                    ensure deviations are investigated to identify root cause(s) and
                     implement corrective and preventive measures as appropriate; and



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -95-                            25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use




                  ensure deviations are approved by a delegated person (after having
                   assessed the impact on quality, safety and efficacy), with the
                   involvement of the Authorised Person as appropriate.
       (b) The Authorised Person should have ultimate responsibility for the batch
           certification (responsibility cannot be delegated). However, it should be
           possible for the Authorised Person of the responsible site to rely on
           data/information that is transmitted to the Authorised Person by qualified and
           trained personnel at the decentralised sites.
          When permitted by national law, the Authorised Person may delegate release
          to trained and qualified personnel at the decentralised site to act under the
          direction of the Authorised Person for exceptional situations (e.g. life
          threatening cases or off-hours). The following conditions apply:

            i.   There is a detailed algorithm that determines the cases when the
                 product can be released at the local site without the preliminary
                 approval of the Authorised Person, including deviations that do not
                 require the intervention of the Authorised Person. If technology permits
                 this step can be performed by a validated computer system.

            ii. The Authorised Person reviews all releases that have occurred at a
                decentralised site within an appropriately justified timeframe to confirm
                the adequacy of the releases including:

                  determining that the local sites can continue release;

                  if any product needs to be recalled or a product alert needs to be
                   issued (see recall section in Chapter 8);

                  if any provision in the release procedure and /or technical
                   agreement needs modification; and

                  the product has not been released without Authorised Person
                   authorisation when required.

CHAPTER 7 OUTSOURCED ACTIVITIES

OTHERS

7.1   Collection of starting materials and highly specialised testing in the jurisdictions
      that are subject to licensing (e.g. karyotype testing, exome sequencing) can be
      outsourced to non GMP licensed third party, as allowed by national law, provided:

      (a) there is a rationale and a justification in the quality system;

      (b) the contract giver takes responsibility to ensure that the contract acceptor
          demonstrates an appropriate level of GMP commensurate to the risk to the
          product and the activities performed using the principles of Annex 20; and




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -96-                              25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



      (c) that proportionate qualifications/validations as appropriate are conducted
          (with reference to Annex 15 and Annex 20) to demonstrate that the activities
          are not detrimental to the quality of the product manufactured.

CHAPTER 8 COMPLAINTS AND PRODUCT RECALL
PRODUCT RECALLS AND OTHER POTENTIAL RISK-REDUCING ACTIONS

8.1   If additional donor (human or animal) health information becomes available after
      procurement, which affects product quality, a ‘look-back’ procedure needs to be
      initiated. This involves an analysis of the risk(s) and of the need for corrective or
      preventive measures.

8.2   In addition to recalls, other risk-reducing actions may be considered to manage
      the risks presented by quality defects, such as the transmission of appropriate
      information to healthcare professionals which may be important for:

      (a) a single batch product (e.g. autologous ATMP where the entire batch has
          been administered), or

      (b) products where patient treatment interruption presents a higher risk than
          continued use of the recalled product.

      In such cases, the MAH/manufacturer needs to provide information to the treating
      physician and to the Competent Authority. Quality defect notifications,
      pharmacovigilance signals and other notifications should also be sent as set in
      national law.

      (Replaces PICS GMP Guide Part I Section 8.31)

8.3   In order to test the robustness of the recall procedure (or healthcare professional
      notification) consideration should be given to performing mock recall or mock
      transmission of appropriate information to healthcare professionals. Such
      evaluations should extend to both within office-hour situations as well as out-of-
      office hour situations.

      The frequency of the mock recall (or mock transmission of appropriate
      information to healthcare professionals) should be justified by the manufacturer
      considering factors such as the stage of the product development and the
      complexity of the supply. For authorised products, a yearly frequency is
      recommended unless otherwise justified.

      (Replaces PICS GMP Guide Part I Section 8.30)

          Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



PART B: SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON SELECTED PRODUCT TYPES
B1. ANIMAL SOURCED PRODUCTS

This guidance applies to animal materials, which includes materials from establishments
such as abattoirs. Since the supply chains can be extensive and complex, controls based
on QRM principles need to be applied, see also requirements of appropriate
pharmacopoeial monographs, including the need for specific tests at defined stages.
Documentation to demonstrate the supply chain traceability5 and clear roles of
participants in the supply chain, typically including a sufficiently detailed and current
process map, should be in place.

B 1.1 Monitoring programmes should be in place for animal disease that is of concern
      to human health. Organisations should take into account reports from trustworthy
      sources on national disease prevalence when compiling their assessment of risk
      and mitigation factors. Such organisations include the World Organisation for
      Animal Health (OIE, Office International des Epizooties). This should be
      supplemented by information on health monitoring and control programme(s) at
      national and local levels, the latter to include the sources (e.g. farm or feedlot)
      from which the animals are drawn and the control measures in place during
      transport to the abattoirs.

B 1.2 Control measures for starting and raw materials at establishments such as
      abattoirs should include appropriate elements of a Quality Management System
      to assure a satisfactory level of operator training, materials traceability, control
      and consistency. These measures may be drawn from sources outside PIC/S
      GMP but should be shown to provide equivalent levels of control. Xenogeneic
      starting material should comply with other national laws.

B 1.3 Control measures for starting or raw materials should be in place, which prevent
      interventions, which may affect the quality of materials, or which at least provides
      evidence of such activities, during their progression through the manufacturing
      and supply chain. This includes the movement of material between sites of initial
      collection, partial and final purification(s), storage sites, hubs, consolidators and
      brokers. Details of such arrangements should be recorded within the traceability
      system and any breaches recorded, investigated and actions taken.

B 1.4 Regular audits of the starting or raw material supplier should be undertaken which
      verify compliance with controls for materials at the different stages of
      manufacture. Issues must be investigated to a depth appropriate to their
      significance, for which full documentation should be available. Systems should
      also be in place to ensure that effective corrective and preventive actions are
      taken.

B 1.5 Cells, tissues and organs intended for the manufacture of xenogeneic cell based
      medicinal products should be obtained only from animals that have been bred in
      captivity (barrier facility) specifically for this purpose and under no circumstances
      should cells, tissues and organs from wild animals or from abattoirs be used.
      Tissues of founder animals similarly should not be used. The health status of the
      animals should be monitored and documented.

    PE 009-17 (Annexes)                    -98-                           25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



B2. GENE THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS (GTMPs)

There are several types of gene therapy products. Synthetic GTMPs are within the scope
of the guidance in this section. For cell-based gene therapy products, some aspects of
the guidance in Section B3 may also be applicable.

B2.1   The manufacture and testing of GTMPs raises specific issues regarding the
       safety and quality of the final product and safety issues for recipients and staff. A
       risk based approach for operator, environment and patient safety and the
       implementation of controls based on the biological hazard class should be
       applied. National requirements and, if applicable, international safety measures
       should be applied.

B2.2   A description of the production of viral and non-viral vectors, nucleic acids (e.g.
       plasmids, linear DNA, mRNA, siRNA) and genetically modified cells should be
       available in sufficient detail to ensure the traceability of the products from the
       starting material (plasmids, gene of interest and regulatory sequences, cell
       banks, and viral or non-viral vector stock) to the finished product.

B2.3   The following considerations apply to the ex-vivo gene transfer to recipient cells:
       (a)   Traceability requirements must be maintained. (refer to Section 4.3 to 4.8)
       (b)   There should be a clear batch definition, from cell source to final product
             container(s). (refer Section 4.2)
       (c)   For products that utilise non-biological means to deliver the gene, their
             physico-chemical properties should be documented and tested.
       (d)   Although the vector used for the manipulation of the cell will not be part of
             the final product, all early processes (e.g. design to construction to
             manufacturing of the plasmid, as well as establishment of cell banks) in the
             manufacture of viral vectors are considered critical and their quality needs
             to be under control. In the case that due to national requirements the
             manufacture of viral vectors are not required under full GMP sufficient
             quality standards (“principles of GMP”) should be applied in their
             manufacture.

Manufacture of Viral Vectors and Plasmids under “principles of GMP”

B2.4   Annex 2A and elements of Part II of the PIC/S GMP Guide can be considered for
       the manufacturing of viral vectors and plasmids where appropriate (refer to the
       examples in light grey in Table 1).

       Manufacturers of viral vectors and plasmids should have a quality management
       system in place that allows them to apply sections of the guideline most relevant
       to ensure the quality of the starting materials having regard to the relevant risks
       for the quality, safety and efficacy of the finished product.

B2.5   The ATMP manufacturer is responsible for appropriate quality of the viral vectors
       and plasmids used as starting materials. Special attention should be given to
       requirements described in section 5.23 to 5.28 of this guideline.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -99-                            25 August 2023
       Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use



       (a) The ATMP manufacturer should follow national requirements and apply QRM
           considering the risk presented by the vector to the safety and quality of the
           ATMP to justify which sections of Annex 2A and elements of Part II of the
           PIC/S GMP Guide are applicable for manufacture and testing of viral vectors
           and plasmids. A defined and controlled manufacturing process should be
           implemented as a result.

       (b) Sufficient quality standards should be applied for the manufacture of
           plasmids used for the establishment of vectors or early stages of mRNA
           GTMPs (refer to Table 1). The design through to construction of the nucleic
           acid (plasmid) preparation by molecular biological and in silico methods is
           considered under the scope of research and development and therefore not
           part of the respective Annex.

       (c) Relevant provisions in Annex 1 are also applicable. The manufacturer should
           justify the applicability extent using QRM. In general, products that can be
           sterile filtered should follow the relevant sections in the Annex 1, otherwise
           aseptic manufacturing provisions should be followed.

B2.6   If the manufacturing of the vectors is outsourced, the ATMP manufacturer should
       assess the risk presented by the vector to the quality and safety of the ATMP and
       thereby select a suitable vector supplier that is able to comply with the GMP
       standards required by national legislation.

       The appropriate sections of Annex 2A and elements of Part II of the PIC/S GMP
       Guide relevant for the specific product should be determined in the agreement
       between the ATMP manufacturer and the vector manufacturer and cover relevant
       aspects (e.g. quality management, documentation, raw materials, cell banks,
       production, testing and control, storage, and other aspects of handling and
       distribution, as appropriate). In addition the vector manufacturer should be part
       of the ATMP manufacturer’s vendor qualification programme. The level of
       supervision and further testing by the ATMP manufacturer should be
       proportionate to the risks posed by the individual materials.

B3     SOMATIC HUMAN AND XENOGENEIC CELL THERAPY PRODUCTS
       AND TISSUE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS AND COMBINED ATMPs

For genetically modified cell-based products that are not classified as GTMPs, some
aspects of guidance in Section B2 may be applicable.

B3.1   In the manufacture of such products involving human or xenogeneic cells
       special attention should be given to traceability requirements (refer to Section
       4.3 to 4.8) and definition of a batch (refer to Section 4.2).
B3.2   Authorised sources of cellular products, bio-molecules, bio-materials,
       scaffolds, matrices, and other substances that are licensed medicinal
       products or medical devices should be used where available.
B3.3   During the life cycle of the product where devices, including custom-made
       devices, are incorporated as part of the product, an appropriate Quality
       Agreement should be made between manufacturer and device suppliers to
       assure consistent quality of the device.

COMMON GLOSSARY TO ANNEX 2A AND 2B
The Glossary in the main GMP Guide applies also to Annex 2A & B. Entries in this
common glossary are only included where the terms are used in Annex 2A & B and
require further explanation. Definitions, which already exist, have been deemed
appropriate.

ATMP Active substance
The active substance of a product is defined in the relevant CTA or MA authorisation
dossier. The ATMP active substance is regarded equivalent to an API.

Adjuvant
A chemical or biological substance that enhances the immune response against an
antigen.

Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP)
ATMP means any of the following medicinal products for human use:

   (a) Gene therapy medicinal product (GTMP):

       ‘GTMP’ means a biological medicinal product, which has the following
       characteristics:

           i.     It contains an active substance, which contains or consists of a
                  recombinant nucleic acid used in or administered to human beings with
                  a view to regulating, repairing, replacing, adding or deleting a genetic
                  sequence;

           ii.    Its therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effect relates directly to the
                  recombinant nucleic acid sequence it contains, or to the product of
                  genetic expression of this sequence.

       Normally GTMPs shall not include vaccines against infectious diseases which
       would be regulated as per Annex 2B. However, the Competent Authority can
       make a determination that should follow Annex 2A when this is beneficial and
       appropriate (e.g. mRNA vaccines that are manufactured using the same
       platform).

   (b) Somatic cell therapy medicinal product:

       ‘Somatic cell therapy medicinal product’ means a biological medicinal product,
       which has the following characteristics:

           i.     contains or consists of cells or tissues that have been subject to
                  substantial manipulation so that biological characteristics, physiological

   (c) Tissue engineered product:

       ‘Tissue engineered product’ means a product that:

            i.    contains or consists of engineered cells or tissues, and

            ii.   is presented as having properties for, or is used in or administered to
                  human beings with a view to regenerating, repairing or replacing a
                  human tissue.

       A tissue-engineered product may contain cells or tissues of human or animal
       origin, or both. The cells or tissues may be viable or non-viable. It may also
       contain additional substances, such as cellular products, bio-molecules,
       biomaterials, chemical substances, scaffolds or matrices. Products containing or
       consisting exclusively of non-viable human or animal cells and/or tissues, which
       do not contain any viable cells or tissues and which do not act principally by
       pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, shall be excluded from this
       definition.

       Cells or tissues shall be considered ‘engineered’ if they fulfil at least one of the
       following conditions:

            i.    the cells or tissues have been subject to substantial manipulation, so
                  that biological characteristics, physiological functions or structural
                  properties relevant for the intended regeneration, repair or replacement
                  are achieved; or

            ii.   the cells or tissues are not intended to be used for the same essential
                  function or functions in the recipient as in the donor.

   (d) Combined ATMPs:

            i.    it must incorporate, as an integral part of the product, one or more
                  medical devices or one or more active implantable medical devices, and
            ii.   its cellular or tissue part must contain viable cells or tissues or its cellular
                  or tissue part containing non-viable cells or tissues must be liable to act
                  upon the human body with action that can be considered as primary to
                  that of the devices referred to.

   (e) A product that is classified or determined to be an ATMP by the PIC/S
       participating authority in its own jurisdiction according to national law.

platforms, beads for separation techniques, chromatographic column material), cryo-
containers for storage and primary packaging material.

Monosepsis (axenic)
A single organism in culture, which is not contaminated with any other.

Multi-product facility
A facility that manufactures, concurrently or in campaign mode, a range of different
ATMPs active substances and products and within which equipment train either may or
may not be dedicated to specific substances or products.

number of applications.

Principles of GMP:
The Annex 2A in conjunction with PIC/S GMP guidelines and annexes describes the
manufacture of ATMP active substances and ATMP drug products. However, aspects of
these guidelines are also relevant for early stages in the ATMP manufacture (e.g.
manufcatur of viral vectors, plasmids) where full GMP is not required under national
legislation. As a result, the ATMP manufacturer should make sure that all relevant GMP
aspects for the manufacturing of those materials are implemented that ensure process
control and consistency, investigation of anomalies and control of change.

ANNEX 2B


     MANUFACTURE OF BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL
   SUBSTANCES AND PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE


SCOPE
      The methods employed in the manufacture of biological active substances and
      biological medicinal products for human use (‘biological active substances and
      medicinal products’) are a critical factor in shaping the appropriate regulatory
      control. Biological active substances and medicinal products can be defined
      therefore largely by reference to their method of manufacture. This annex
      provides guidance on the full range of active substances and medicinal products
      defined as biological with the exception of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products
      (“ATMPs”). The ATMPs are not covered by the present guideline. Manufacturers
      of ATMPs should refer to PIC/S Annnex 2A Manufacture of Advanced Therapy
      Medicinal Products for Human Use.

      This annex is divided into two main parts:
      a)    Part A contains supplementary guidance on the manufacture of biological
            active substances and medicinal products, from control over seed lots and
            cell banks through to finishing activities and testing.
      b)    Part B contains further guidance on selected types of biological active
            substances and medicinal products.

      This annex, along with several other annexes of the PIC/S Guide to GMP,
      provides guidance which supplements that in Part I and in Part II of the Guide.
      There are two aspects to the scope of this annex:
      a)    Stage of manufacture - for biological active substances to the point
            immediately prior to their being rendered sterile, the primary guidance
            source is Part II. Guidance for the subsequent manufacturing steps of
            biological products are covered in Part I.
      b)    Type of product - this annex provides guidance on the full range of
            medicinal products defined as biological with the exception of ATMPs.

      These two aspects are shown in Table 1; it should be noted that this table is
      illustrative only and is not meant to describe the precise scope. It should also be
      understood that in line with the corresponding table in Part II of the Guide, the
      level of GMP increases in detail from early to later steps in the manufacture of
      biological active substances but GMP principles should always be adhered to.
      The inclusion of some early steps of manufacture within the scope of this Annex
      does not imply that those steps will be routinely subject to inspection by the
      authorities.




PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -108-                          25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



          Antibiotics are not defined as biological medicinal products, however where
          biological stages of manufacture occur, guidance in this Annex may be used.

          Guidance for medicinal products derived from fractionated human blood or
          plasma is covered in Annex 14 and for non-transgenic plant products in Annex 7.

          In certain cases, other legislation may be applicable to the starting materials for
          biologicals. For example,
          (a)     Tissue and cells used as starting materials for medicinal products,
                  donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and
                  distribution of human tissues and cells of tissue and cells may be covered
                  by national legislation. Such tissues and cells may provide the active
                  substances for some biological medicinal product within the scope of this
                  annex at which point GMP and other medicinal product legislation
                  requirements apply.
          (b)     Blood or blood components used as starting materials for medicinal
                  products, national legislation may provide the technical requirements for
                  the selection of donors, collection, testing, processing, storage, and
                  distribution of human blood and blood components1.
          Additionally, the manufacture and control of genetically modified organisms
          needs to comply with local and national requirements. Appropriate containment
          should be established and maintained in facilities where any genetically modified
          micro-organism is handled2. Advice should be obtained according to national
          legislation in order to establish and maintain the appropriate Biological Safety
          Level. There should be no conflicts with GMP requirements.

PRINCIPLE
          The manufacture of biological active substances and medicinal products involves
          certain specific considerations arising from the nature of the products and the
          processes. The ways in which biological medicinal products are manufactured,
          controlled and administered make some particular precautions necessary.

          Unlike conventional medicinal products, which are manufactured using chemical
          and physical techniques capable of a high degree of consistency, the
          manufacture of biological active substances and medicinal products involves
          biological processes and materials, such as cultivation of cells or extraction from
          living organisms. These biological processes may display inherent variability, so
          that the range and nature of by-products may be variable. As a result, quality risk
          management (QRM) principles are particularly important for this class of
          materials and should be used to develop the control strategy across all stages of
          manufacture so as to minimise variability and to reduce the opportunity for
          contamination and cross-contamination.

          Since materials and processing conditions used in cultivation processes are
          designed to provide conditions for the growth of specific cells and
          microorganisms, this provides extraneous microbial contaminants the opportunity

5    In the EEA: HMPC guideline on Good Agricultural and Collection Practice - EMEA/HMPC/246816/2005
     may be applied to growing, harvesting and initial processing in open fields.
6    For principles of GMP apply, see explanatory text in ‘Scope’.
7    In the EEA, human tissues and cells must comply with Directive 2004/23/EC and implementing Directives
     at these stages.



    PE 009-17 (Annexes)                              -110-                                     25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



          to grow. In addition, some products may be limited in their ability to withstand a
          wide range of purification techniques particularly those designed to inactivate or
          remove adventitious viral contaminants. The design of the processes, equipment,
          facilities, utilities, the conditions of preparation and addition of buffers and
          reagents, sampling and training of the operators are key considerations to
          minimise such contamination events.

          Specifications related to products (such as those in Pharmacopoeial
          monographs, Clinical Trial Authorisation (CTA), and Marketing Authorisation
          (MA)) will dictate whether and to what stage substances and materials can have
          a defined level of bioburden or need to be sterile. Similarly, manufacturing must
          be consistent with other specifications set out in the CTA or MA (e.g. number of
          generations (doublings, passages) between the seed lot or cell bank).

          For biological materials that cannot be sterilized (e.g. by filtration), processing
          must be conducted aseptically to minimise the introduction of contaminants.
          Where they exist, other guidance documents should be consulted on the
          validation of specific manufacturing methods, e.g. virus removal or inactivation.
          The application of appropriate environmental controls and monitoring and,
          wherever feasible, in-situ cleaning and sterilisation systems together with the use
          of closed systems can significantly reduce the risk of accidental contamination
          and cross-contamination.

          Control usually involves biological analytical techniques, which typically have a
          greater variability than physico-chemical determinations. A robust manufacturing
          process is therefore crucial and in-process controls take on a particular
          importance in the manufacture of biological active substances and medicinal
          products.

          Biological medicinal products which incorporate human tissues or cells must
          comply with national requirements for the coding, processing, preservation,
          storage and distribution of human tissues and cells.8 Collection and testing of this
          material must be done in accordance with an appropriate quality system and in
          accordance with applicable national requirements9. Furthermore, national
          requirements10 on traceability apply from the donor (while maintaining donor
          confidentiality) through stages applicable at the Tissue Establishment and then
          continued under medicines legislation through to the institution where the product
          is used.

          Biological active substances and medicinal products must comply with the
          applicable national guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal
          spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal
          products.

Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



PART A:       GENERAL GUIDANCE

PERSONNEL
1.     Personnel (including those concerned with cleaning, maintenance or quality
       control) employed in areas where biological active substances and products are
       manufactured and tested should receive training, and periodic retraining, specific
       to the products manufactured and to their work, including any specific security
       measures to protect product, personnel and the environment.

2.     The health status of personnel should be taken into consideration for product
       safety. Where necessary, personnel engaged in production, maintenance, testing
       and animal care (and inspections) should be vaccinated with appropriate specific
       vaccines and have regular health checks.

3.     Any changes in the health status of personnel, which could adversely affect the
       quality of the product, should preclude work in the production area and
       appropriate records kept. Production of BCG vaccine and tuberculin products
       should be restricted to staff who are carefully monitored by regular checks of
       immunological status or chest X-ray. Health monitoring of staff should be
       commensurate with the risk, medical advice should be sought for personnel
       involved with hazardous organisms.

4.     Where required to minimise the opportunity for cross-contamination, restrictions
       on the movement of all personnel (including quality control (QC), maintenance
       and cleaning staff) should be controlled on the basis of QRM principles. In
       general, personnel should not pass from areas where exposure to live
       micro-organisms, genetically modified organisms, toxins or animals to areas
       where other products, inactivated products or different organisms are handled. If
       such passage is unavoidable, the contamination control measures should be
       based on QRM principles.


PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT
5.     As part of the control strategy, the degree of environmental control of particulate
       and microbial contamination of the production premises should be adapted to the
       active substance, intermediate or finished product and the production step,
       bearing in mind the potential level of contamination of the starting materials and
       the risks to the product. The environmental monitoring programme should be
       supplemented by the inclusion of methods to detect the presence of specific
       microorganisms (i.e. host organism, yeasts, moulds, anaerobes, etc) where
       indicated by the QRM process.

6.     Manufacturing and storage facilities, processes and environmental classifications
       should be designed to prevent the extraneous contamination of products.
       Prevention of contamination is more appropriate than detection and removal,
       although contamination is likely to become evident during processes such as
       fermentation and cell culture. Where processes are not closed and there is
       therefore exposure of the product to the immediate room environment (e.g. during
       additions of supplements, media, buffers, gasses,) control measures should be
       put in place, including engineering and environmental controls on the basis of


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -112-                          25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



          QRM principles. These QRM principles should take into account the principles
          and guidance from the appropriate sections of Annex 111 when selecting
          environmental classification cascades and associated controls.

7.        Dedicated production areas should be used for the handling of live cells.
          Dedicated production area should be used for the manufacture of pathogenic
          organisms (i.e. Biosafety level 3 or 4).

8.        Manufacture in a multi-product facility may be acceptable where the following, or
          equivalent (as appropriate to the product types involved) considerations and
          measures are part of an effective control strategy to prevent cross-contamination:
          (a)     Knowledge of key characteristics of all cells, organisms and any
                  adventitious agents (e.g. pathogenicity, detectability, persistence,
                  susceptibility to inactivation) within the same facility.
          (b)     Where production is characterised by multiple small batches from different
                  starting materials, factors such as the health status of donors and the risk
                  of total loss of product should be taken into account when considering the
                  acceptance of concurrent working during development of the control
                  strategy.
          (c)     Live organisms and spores are prevented from entering non-related areas
                  or equipment by addressing all potential routes of cross-contamination and
                  utilizing single use components and engineering measures such as closed
                  systems.
          (d)     Control measures to remove the organisms and spores before the
                  subsequent manufacture of other products, these control measures should
                  also take the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system into
                  account. Cleaning and decontamination for the organisms and spores
                  should be validated.
          (e)     Environmental monitoring, specific for the micro-organism being
                  manufactured, where the micro-organisms are capable of persistence in
                  the manufacturing environment and where methods are available, is
                  conducted in adjacent areas during manufacture and after completion of
                  cleaning and decontamination. Attention should also be given to risks
                  arising with use of certain monitoring equipment (e.g. airborne particle
                  monitoring) in areas handling live and/or spore forming organisms.
          (f)     Products, equipment, ancillary equipment (e.g. for calibration and
                  validation) and disposable items are only moved within and removed from
                  such areas in a manner that prevents contamination of other areas, other
                  products and different product stages (e.g. prevent contamination of
                  inactivated or toxoided products with non-inactivated products).
          (g)     Campaign based manufacturing.




11   Although the title of Annex 1 refers to the manufacture of sterile medicinal products it is not the intention
     to force the manufacture of sterile product at a stage when a low bioburden is appropriate and authorised.
     Its use is because it is the PIC/S GMP source of guidance on all of the classified manufacturing areas
     including the lower grades D and C.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                                  -113-                                   25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



9.        For finishing (secondary) operations12, the need for dedicated facilities will
          depend on consideration of the above together with additional considerations
          such as the specific needs of the biological medicinal product and on the
          characteristics of other products, including any non-biological products, in the
          same facility. Other control measures for finishing operations may include the
          need for specific addition sequences, mixing speeds, time and temperature
          controls, limits on exposure to light and containment and cleaning procedures in
          the event of spillages.

10.       The measures and procedures necessary for containment (i.e. for environment
          and operator safety) should not conflict with those for product quality.

11.       Air handling units should be designed, constructed and maintained to minimise
          the risk of cross-contamination between different manufacturing areas and may
          need to be specific for an area. Consideration, based on QRM principles, should
          be given to the use of single pass air systems.

12.       Positive pressure areas should be used to process sterile products but negative
          pressure in specific areas at the point of exposure of pathogens is acceptable for
          containment reasons. Where negative pressure areas or safety cabinets are used
          for aseptic processing of materials with particular risks (e.g. pathogens), they
          should be surrounded by a positive pressure clean zone of appropriate grade.
          These pressure cascades should be clearly defined and continuously monitored
          with appropriate alarm settings.

13.       Equipment used during handling of live organisms and cells, including those for
          sampling, should be designed to prevent any contamination during processing.

14.       Primary containment13 should be designed and periodically tested to ensure the
          prevention of escape of biological agents into the immediate working
          environment.

15.       The use of 'clean in place' and ‘steam in place’ (‘sterilisation in place’) systems
          should be used where possible. Valves on fermentation vessels should be
          completely steam sterilisable.

16.       Air vent filters should be hydrophobic and validated for their scheduled life span
          with integrity testing at appropriate intervals based on appropriate QRM
          principles.

17.       Drainage systems must be designed so that effluents can be effectively
          neutralised or decontaminated to minimise the risk of cross-contamination. Local
          regulation must be complied with to minimise the risk of contamination of the
          external environment according to the risk associated with the biohazardous
          nature of waste materials.

18.       Due to the variability of biological products or manufacturing processes,
          relevant/critical raw materials (such as culture media and buffers) have to be
          measured or weighed during the production process. In these cases, small stocks

 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                           -114-                        25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



       of these raw materials may be kept in the production area for a specified duration
       based on defined criteria such as for the duration of manufacture of the batch or
       of the campaign.


ANIMALS
19.    A wide range of animal species are used in the manufacture of a number of
       biological medicinal products. These can be divided into 2 broad types of
       sources:
       (a)   Live groups, herds, flocks: examples include polio vaccine (monkeys),
             immunosera to snake venoms and tetanus (horses, sheep and goats),
             allergens (cats), rabies vaccine (rabbits, mice and hamsters), transgenic
             products (goats, cattle).
       (b)   Animal materials derived post-mortem and from establishments such as
             abattoirs: examples include, abattoir sources for enzymes, anticoagulants
             and hormones (sheep and pigs).
       In addition, animals may also be used in quality control either in generic assays,
       e.g. pyrogenicity, or specific potency assays, e.g. pertussis vaccine (mice),
       pyrogenicity (rabbits), BCG vaccine (guinea-pigs).

20.    In addition to compliance with TSE regulations, other adventitious agents that are
       of concern (zoonotic diseases, diseases of source animals) should be monitored
       by an ongoing health programme and recorded. Specialist advice should be
       obtained in establishing such programmes. Instances of ill-health occurring in the
       source/donor animals should be investigated with respect to their suitability and
       the suitability of in-contact animals for continued use (in manufacture, as sources
       of starting and raw materials, in quality control and safety testing), the decisions
       must be documented. A look-back procedure should be in place which informs
       the decision making process on the continued suitability of the biological active
       substanceor medicinal productin which the animal sourced starting or raw
       materials have been used or incorporated. This decision-making process may
       include the re-testing of retained samples from previous collections from the
       same donor animal (where applicable) to establish the last negative donation.
       The withdrawal period of therapeutic agents used to treat source/donor animals
       must be documented and used to determine the removal of those animals from
       the programme for defined periods.

21.    Particular care should be taken to prevent and monitor infections in the source /
       donor animals. Measures should include the sourcing, facilities, husbandry,
       biosecurity procedures, testing regimes, control of bedding and feed materials.
       This is of special relevance to specified pathogen free animals where
       pharmacopoeial monograph requirements must be met. Housing and health
       monitoring should be defined for other categories of animals (e.g. healthy flocks
       or herds).

22.    For products manufactured from transgenic animals, traceability should be
       maintained in the creation of such animals from the source animals.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -115-                           25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



23.       Note should be taken of national requirements on the protection of animals used
          for scientific purposes14. Housing for animals used in production and control of
          biological active substances and medicinal products should be separated from
          production and control areas.

24.       For different animal species, key criteria should be defined, monitored, and
          recorded. These may include age, weight and health status of the animals.

25.       Animals, biological agents, and tests carried out should be the subject of an
          identification system to prevent any risk of confusion and to control all identified
          hazards.


DOCUMENTATION
26.       Starting and raw materials may need additional documentation on the source,
          origin, distribution chain, method of manufacture, and controls applied, to assure
          an appropriate level of control including their microbiological quality.

27.       Some product types may require specific definition of what materials constitutes
          a batch, particularly cells.

28.       Where human cell or tissue donors are used, full traceability is required from
          starting and raw materials, including all substances coming into contact with the
          cells or tissues through to confirmation of the receipt of the products at the point
          of use whilst maintaining the privacy of individuals and confidentiality of health
          related information15. Traceability records must be retained for 30 years after the
          expiry date of the medicinal product. Particular care should be taken to maintain
          the traceability of products for special use cases, such as donor-matched cells.
          National requirements16 in regards to traceability requirements and notification of
          serious adverse reactions and events apply to blood components when they are
          used as starting or raw materials in the manufacturing process of medicinal
          products.


PRODUCTION
29.       Given the variability inherent in many biological active substances and medicinal
          products, steps to increase process robustness thereby reducing process
          variability and enhancing reproducibility at the different stages of the product
          lifecycle such as process design should be reassessed during Product Quality
          Reviews.

30.       Since cultivation conditions, media and reagents are designed to promote the
          growth of cells or microbial organisms, typically in an axenic state, particular
          attention should be paid in the control strategy to ensure there are robust steps
          that prevent or minimise the occurrence of unwanted bioburden and associated
          metabolites and endotoxins. For medicinal products from cells and tissues where

14   In the EEA, this is Directive 2010/63/EC.
15   In the EEA, see Article 15 of Regulation 1394/ 2007.
16   In the EEA, these are Directives 2002/98/EC and 2005/61/EC.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                             -116-                       25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



       production batches are frequently small the risk of cross-contamination between
       cell preparations from different donors with various health status should be
       controlled under defined procedures and requirements.


STARTING AND RAW MATERIALS
31.    The source, origin and suitability of biological starting and raw materials (e.g.
       cryoprotectants, feeder cells, reagents, culture media, buffers, serum, enzymes,
       cytokines, growth factors) should be clearly defined. Where the necessary tests
       take a long time, it may be permissible to process starting materials before the
       results of the tests are available, the risk of using a potentially failed material and
       its potential impact on other batches should be clearly understood and assessed
       under the principles of QRM. In such cases, release of a finished product is
       conditional on satisfactory results of these tests. The identification of all starting
       materials should be in compliance with the requirements appropriate to its stage
       of manufacture. For biological medicinal products further guidance can be found
       in Part I and Annex 8 and for biological active substances in Part II.

32.    The risk of contamination of starting and raw materials during their passage along
       the supply chain must be assessed, with particular emphasis on TSE. Materials
       that come into direct contact with manufacturing equipment or the product (such
       as media used in media fill experiments and lubricants that may contact the
       product) must also be taken into account.

33.    Given that the risks from the introduction of contamination and the consequences
       to the finished product is the same irrespective of the stage of manufacture,
       establishment of a control strategy to protect the product and the preparation of
       solutions, buffers and other additions should be based on the principles and
       guidance contained in the appropriate sections of Annex 1. The controls required
       for the quality of starting and raw materials and on the aseptic manufacturing
       process, assume greater importance particularly for products, in respect of which
       final sterilisation is not possible. Where a CTA or MA provides for an allowable
       type and level of bioburden, for example at active substance stage, the control
       strategy should address the means by which this is maintained within the
       specified limits.

34.    Where sterilisation of starting and raw materials is required, it should be carried
       out where possible by heat. Where necessary, other appropriate methods may
       also be used for inactivation of biological materials (e.g. irradiation and filtration).

35.    Reduction in bioburden associated with procurement of living tissues and cells
       may require the use of other measures such as antibiotics at early manufacturing
       stages. This should be avoided, but where it is necessary their use should be
       justified, they should be removed from the manufacturing process at the stage
       specified in the CTA or MA.

Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



36.       The donation, procurement and testing of human tissues and cells used as
          starting materials for biological medicinal products should be in accordance with
          national law requirements. 17 Traceability for human tissues and cells used as
          starting materials for biological medicinal products should be maintained from the
          donor to the batch of a finished medicinal product. Appropriate arrangements
          should be made between the manufacturer and the supplier of tissues and cells
          regarding the transfer of health donor information that may become available
          after the supply of the starting material and which may have an impact on the
          quality or safety of the medicinal product manufactured therefrom.
          (a)    Their procurement, donation and testing is regulated in some countries18.
                 Such supply sites must hold appropriate approvals from the national
                 competent authority(ies) which should be verified as part of starting
                 material supplier management.
          (b)    Where such human cells or tissues are imported, they must meet
                 equivalent national standards of quality and safety19. The traceability and
                 serious adverse reaction and serious adverse event notification
                 requirements may be set out in national legislation20.
          (c)    There may be some instances where processing of cells and tissues used
                 as starting materials for biological medicinal products will be conducted at
                 tissue establishments21.
          (d)    Tissue and cells are released by the Responsible Person (RP) in the tissue
                 establishment before shipment to the medicinal product manufacturer, after
                 which normal medicinal product starting material controls apply. The test
                 results of all tissues / cells supplied by the tissue establishment should be
                 available to the manufacturer of the medicinal product. Such information
                 must be used to make appropriate material segregation and storage
                 decisions. In cases where manufacturing must be initiated prior to receiving
                 test results from the tissue establishment, tissue and cells may be shipped
                 to the medicinal product manufacturer provided controls are in place to
                 prevent cross-contamination with tissue and cells that have been released
                 by the RP in the tissue establishment.
          (e)    The transport of human tissues and cells to the manufacturing site must be
                 controlled by a written agreement between the responsible parties. The
                 manufacturing sites should have documentary evidence of adherence to
                 the specified storage and transport conditions.
          (f)    Continuation of traceability requirements started at tissue establishments
                 through to the recipient(s), and vice versa, including materials in contact
                 with the cells or tissues, should be maintained.
          (g)    A technical agreement should be in place between the responsible parties
                 (e.g. manufacturers, tissue establishment, Sponsors, MA Holder) which
                 defines the tasks of each party, including the RP and Authorised Person.

37.       (…)22

38.       Where human or animal cells are used in the manufacturing process as feeder
          cells, appropriate controls over the sourcing, testing, transport and storage
          should be in place23, including control of compliance with national requirements
          for human cells.


SEED LOT AND CELL BANK SYSTEM
39.       In order to prevent the unwanted drift of properties which might ensue from
          repeated subcultures or multiple generations, the production of biological
          medicinal substances and products obtained by microbial culture, cell culture or
          propagation in embryos and animals should be based on a system of master and
          working virus seed lots and/or cell banks.

40.       The number of generations (doublings, passages) between the seed lot or cell
          bank, the biological active substance and the finished product should be
          consistent with specifications in the CTA or MA.

41.       As part of product lifecycle management, establishment of seed lots and cell
          banks, including master and working generations, should be performed under
          appropriate GMP conditions. This should include an appropriately controlled
          environment to protect the seed lot and the cell bank and the personnel handling
          it. During the establishment of the seed lot and cell bank, no other living or
          infectious material (e.g. virus, cell lines or cell strains) should be handled
          simultaneously in the same area or by the same persons. For all stages prior to
          the establishment of the master seed or cell bank generation, principles of GMP
          may be applied. For all pre-master bank stages, documentation should be
          available to support traceability. All issues related to components used during the
          development with potential impact on product safety (e.g. reagents of biological
          origin) from initial sourcing and genetic development should be documented. For
          vaccines the requirements of pharmacopoeial monographs will apply24.

42.       Following the establishment of master and working cell banks and master and
          working seed lots, quarantine and release procedures should be followed. This
          should include adequate characterization and testing for contaminants. Their
          on-going suitability for use should be further demonstrated by the consistency of
          the characteristics and quality of the successive batches of product. Evidence of
          the stability and recovery of the seeds and banks should be documented and
          records should be kept in a manner permitting trend evaluation.

43.       Seed lots and cell banks should be stored and used in such a way as to minimize
          the risks of contamination (e.g. stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen in
          sealed containers) or alteration. Ensuring compliance with measures for the
          storage of different seeds and/or cells in the same area or equipment should

          prevent mix-up and take into account the infectious nature of the materials to
          prevent cross contamination.

44.       (…)25

45.       Storage containers should be sealed, clearly labelled and kept at an appropriate
          temperature. A stock inventory must be kept. The storage temperature should be
          recorded continuously and, where used, the liquid nitrogen level monitored.
          Deviation from set limits and corrective and preventive action taken should be
          recorded.

46.       It is desirable to split stocks and to store the split stocks at different locations so
          as to minimize the risks of total loss. The controls at such locations should provide
          the assurances outlined in the preceding paragraphs.

47.       The storage and handling conditions for stocks should be managed according to
          the same procedures and parameters. Once containers are removed from the
          seed lot / cell bank management system, the containers should not be returned
          to stock.


OPERATING PRINCIPLES
48.       Change management should, on a periodic basis, take into account the effects,
          including cumulative effects of changes (e.g. to the process) on the quality, safety
          and efficacy of the finished product.

49.       Critical operational (process) parameters, or other input parameters which affect
          product quality, need to be identified, validated, documented and be shown to be
          maintained within requirements.

50.       A control strategy for the entry of articles and materials into production areas
          should be based on QRM principles. For aseptic processes, heat stable articles
          and materials entering a clean area or clean/contained area should preferably do
          so through a double-ended autoclave or oven. Heat labile articles and materials
          should enter through an air lock with interlocked doors where they are subject to
          effective surface sanitisation procedures. Sterilisation of articles and materials
          elsewhere is acceptable provided that they are multiple wrappings, as
          appropriate to the number of stages of entry to the clean area, and enter through
          an airlock with the appropriate surface sanitisation precautions.

51.       The growth promoting properties of culture media should be demonstrated to be
          suitable for its intended use. If possible, media should be sterilized in situ. In-line
          sterilizing filters for routine addition of gases, media, acids or alkalis, anti-foaming
          agents etc. to fermenters should be used where possible.

52.       Addition of materials or cultures to fermenters and other vessels and sampling
          should be carried out under carefully controlled conditions to prevent

 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                              -120-                               25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



       contamination. Care should be taken to ensure that vessels are correctly
       connected when addition or sampling takes place.

53.    Continuous monitoring of some production processes (e.g. fermentation) may be
       necessary; such data should form part of the batch record. Where continuous
       culture is used, special consideration should be given to the quality control
       requirements arising from this type of production method.

54.    Centrifugation and blending of products can lead to aerosol formation and
       containment of such activities to minimise cross-contamination is necessary.

55.    Accidental spillages, especially of live organisms, must be dealt with quickly and
       safely. Qualified decontamination measures should be available for each
       organism or groups of related organisms. Where different strains of single
       bacteria species or very similar viruses are involved, the decontamination
       process may be validated with one representative strain, unless there is reason
       to believe that they may vary significantly in their resistance to the agent(s)
       involved.

56.    If obviously contaminated, such as by spills or aerosols, or if a potential
       hazardous organism is involved, production and control materials, including
       paperwork, must be adequately disinfected, or the information transferred out by
       other means.

57.    In cases where a virus inactivation or removal process is performed during
       manufacture, measures should be taken to avoid the risk of recontamination of
       treated products by non-treated products.

58.    For products that are inactivated by the addition of a reagent (e.g.
       micro-organisms in the course of vaccine manufacture) the process should
       ensure the complete inactivation of live organism. In addition to the thorough
       mixing of culture and inactivant, consideration should be given to contact of all
       product-contact surfaces exposed to live culture and, where required, the transfer
       to a second vessel.

59.    A wide variety of equipment is used for chromatography. QRM principles should
       be used to devise the control strategy on matrices, the housings and associated
       equipment when used in campaign manufacture and in multi-product
       environments. The re-use of the same matrix at different stages of processing is
       discouraged. Acceptance criteria, operating conditions, regeneration methods,
       life span and sanitization or sterilisation methods of columns should be defined.

60.    Where irradiated equipment and materials are used, Annex 12 should be
       consulted for further guidance.

61.    There should be a system to assure the integrity and closure of containers after
       filling where the final products or intermediates represent a special risk and
       procedures to deal with any leaks or spillages. Filling and packaging operations
       need to have procedures in place to maintain the product within any specified
       limits, e.g. time and/or temperature.

62.    Activities in handling vials containing live biological agents, must be performed
       in such a way to prevent the contamination of other products or egress of the live


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -121-                           25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



          agents into the work environment or the external environment. The viability of
          such organisms and their biological classification should take into consideration
          as part of the management of such risks.

63.       Care should be taken in the preparation, printing, storage and application of
          labels, including any specific text for patient-specific product of the contents on
          the immediate and outer packaging.

          In the case of autologous products, the unique patient identifier and the statement
          “for autologous use only” should be indicated on the outer packaging or, where
          there is no outer packaging, on the immediate packaging.

64.       The compatibility of labels with ultra-low storage temperatures, where such
          temperatures are used, should be verified.

65.       Where donor (human or animal health) information becomes available after
          procurement, which affects product quality, it should be taken into account in
          recall procedures.


QUALITY CONTROL
66.       In-process controls have a greater importance in ensuring the consistency of the
          quality of biological active substance and medicinal products than for
          conventional products. In-process control testing should be performed at
          appropriate stages of production to control those conditions that are important for
          the quality of the finished product.

67.       Where intermediates can be stored for extended periods of time (days, weeks or
          longer), consideration should be given to the inclusion of finished product batches
          made from materials held for their maximum in-process periods in the on-going
          stability programme.

68.       (…) 26

69.       For cellular products, sterility tests should be conducted on antibiotic-free cultures
          of cells or cell banks to provide evidence for absence of bacterial and fungal
          contamination and to be able to detection fastidious organisms where
          appropriate.

70.       For biological medicinal products with a short shelf life, which for the purposes
          of the annex is taken to mean a period that does not permit release when sterility
          testing results are provided after 14 days or less, and which need batch
          certification before completion of all end product quality control tests (e.g. sterility
          tests) a suitable control strategy must be in place. Such controls need to be built
          on enhanced understanding of product and process performance and take into
          account the controls and attributes of starting and raw materials. The exact and
          detailed description of the entire release procedure, including the responsibilities
          of the different personnel involved in assessment of production and analytical

 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                              -122-                               25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



          data is essential. A continuous assessment of the effectiveness of the quality
          assurance system must be in place including records kept in a manner which
          permit trend evaluation.

          Where end product tests are not available due to their short shelf life, alternative
          methods of obtaining equivalent data to permit batch certification should be
          considered (e.g. rapid microbiological methods). The procedure for batch
          certification and release may be carried out in two or more stages:

          (a)    Assessment by designated person(s) of batch processing records, results
                 from environmental monitoring (where available) which should cover
                 production conditions, all deviations from normal procedures and the
                 available analytical results for review in preparation for the initial
                 certification by the Responsible Person.
          (b)    Assessment of the final analytical tests and other information available for
                 final certification by the Authorised Person. A procedure should be in place
                 to describe the measures to be taken (including liaison with clinical staff)
                 where out of specification test results are obtained. Such events should be
                 fully investigated and the relevant corrective and preventive actions taken
                 to prevent recurrence documented.


PART B:            SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON SELECTED PRODUCT
TYPES

B1.       ANIMAL SOURCED PRODUCTS27
          This guidance applies to animal materials which includes materials from
          establishments such as abattoirs. Since the supply chains can be extensive and
          complex, controls based on QRM principles need to be applied, see also
          requirements of appropriate pharmacopoeial monographs, including the need for
          specific tests at defined stages. Documentation to demonstrate the supply chain
          traceability28 and clear roles of participants in the supply chain, typically including
          a sufficiently detailed and current process map, should be in place.

1.        Monitoring programmes should be in place for animal disease that are of concern
          to human health. Organisations should take into account reports from trustworthy
          sources on national disease prevalence when compiling their assessment of risk
          and mitigation factors. Such organisations include the World Organisation for
          Animal Health (OIE, Office International des Epizooties29). This should be
          supplemented by information on health monitoring and control programme(s) at
          national and local levels, the latter to include the sources (e.g. farm or feedlot)
          from which the animals are drawn and the control measures in place during
          transport to the abattoirs.

2.        Where abattoirs are used to source animal tissues, they should be shown to
          operate to stringent standards. Account should be taken of reports from national

 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                            -123-                           25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



          regulatory organisations30 which verify compliance with the requirements of food
          safety and quality, veterinary and plant health legislation.

3.        Control measures for starting or raw materials at establishments such as
          abattoirs should include appropriate elements of a Quality Management System
          to assure a satisfactory level of operator training, materials traceability, control
          and consistency. These measures may be drawn from sources outside PIC/S
          GMP but should be shown to provide equivalent levels of control.

4.        Control measures for starting or raw materials should be in place which prevent
          interventions which may affect the quality of materials, or which at least provides
          evidence of such activities, during their progression through the manufacturing
          and supply chain. This includes the movement of material between sites of initial
          collection, partial and final purification(s), storage sites, hubs, consolidators and
          brokers. Details of such arrangements should be recorded within the traceability
          system and any breaches recorded, investigated and actions taken.

5.        Regular audits of the starting or raw material supplier should be undertaken which
          verify compliance with controls for materials at the different stages of
          manufacture. Issues must be investigated to a depth appropriate to their
          significance, for which full documentation should be available. Systems should
          also be in place to ensure that effective corrective and preventive actions are
          taken.


B2.       ALLERGEN PRODUCTS
          Materials may be manufactured by extraction from natural sources or
          manufactured by recombinant DNA technology.

1.        Source materials should be described in sufficient detail to ensure consistency in
          their supply, e.g. common and scientific name, origin, nature, contaminant limits,
          method of collection. Those derived from animals should be from healthy
          sources. Appropriate biosecurity controls should be in place for colonies (e.g.
          mites, animals) used for the extraction of allergens. Allergen products should be
          stored under defined conditions to minimise deterioration.

2.        The production process steps including pre-treatment, extraction, filtration,
          dialysis, concentration or freeze-drying steps should be described in detail and
          validated.

3.        The modification processes to manufacture modified allergen extracts (e.g.
          allergoids, conjugates) should be described. Intermediates in the manufacturing
          process should be identified and controlled.

4.        Allergen extract mixtures should be prepared from individual extracts from single
          source materials. Each individual extract should be considered as one active
          substance.

Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



B.3    ANIMAL IMMUNOSERA PRODUCTS
1.     Particular care should be exercised on the control of antigens of biological origin
       to assure their quality, consistency and freedom from adventitious agents. The
       preparation of materials used to immunise the source animals (e.g. antigens,
       hapten carriers, adjuvants, stabilising agents), the storage of such material
       immediately prior to immunisation should be in accordance with documented
       procedures.

2.     The immunisation, test bleed and harvest bleed schedules should conform to
       those approved in the CTA or MA.

3.     The manufacturing conditions for the preparation of antibody sub-fragments (e.g.
       Fab or F(ab’)2) and any further modifications must be in accordance with
       validated and approved parameters. Where such enzymes are made up of
       several components, their consistency should be assured.


B.4    VACCINES
1.     Where eggs are used, the health status of all source flocks used in the production
       of eggs (whether specified pathogen free or healthy flocks) should be assured.

2.     The integrity of containers used to store intermediate products and the hold times
       must be validated.

3.     Vessels containing inactivated products should not be opened or sampled in
       areas containing live biological agents.

4.     The sequence of addition of active ingredients, adjuvants and excipients during
       the formulation of an intermediate or final product must be in compliance with
       specifications.

5.     Where organisms with a higher biological safety level (e.g. pandemic vaccine
       strains) are to be used in manufacture or testing, appropriate containment
       arrangements must be in place. The approval of such arrangements should be
       obtained from the appropriate national authority(ies) and the approval documents
       be available for verification.


B.5    RECOMBINANT PRODUCTS
1.     Process condition during cell growth, protein expression and purification must be
       maintained within validated parameters to assure a consistent product with a
       defined range of impurities that is within the capability of the process to reduce
       to acceptable levels. The type of cell used in production may require increased
       measures to be taken to assure freedom from viruses. For production involving
       multiple harvest, the period of continuous cultivation should be within specified
       limits.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -125-                          25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use



2.     The purification processes to remove unwanted host cell proteins, nucleic acids,
       carbohydrates, viruses and other impurities should be within defined validated
       limits.


B6.    MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PRODUCTS
1.     Monoclonal antibodies may be manufactured from murine hybridomas, human
       hybridomas or by recombinant DNA technology. Control measures appropriate
       to the different source cells (including feeder cells if used) and materials used to
       establish the hybridoma / cell line should be in place to assure the safety and
       quality of the product. It should be verified that these are within approved limits.
       Freedom from viruses should be given particular emphasis. It should be noted
       that data originating from products generated by the same manufacturing
       technology platform may be acceptable to demonstrate suitability.

2.     Criteria to be monitored at the end of a production cycle and for early termination
       of production cycles should be verified that these are within approved limits.

3.     The manufacturing conditions for the preparation of antibody sub-fragment (e.g.
       Fab, F(ab’)2, scFv) and any further modifications (e.g. radio labelling, conjugation,
       chemical linking) must be in accordance with validated parameters.


B7.    TRANSGENIC ANIMAL PRODUCTS
       Consistency of starting material from a transgenic source is likely to be more
       problematic than is normally the case for non-transgenic biotechnology sources.
       Consequently, there is an increased requirement to demonstrate batch-to-batch
       consistency of product in all respects.

1.     A range of species may be used to produce biological medicinal products, which
       may be expressed into body fluids (e.g. milk) for collection and purification.
       Animals should be clearly and uniquely identified and backup arrangements
       should be put in place in the event of loss of the primary marker.

2.     The arrangements for housing and care of the animals should be defined such
       that they minimise the exposure of the animals to pathogenic and zoonotic
       agents. Appropriate measures to protect the external environment should be
       established. A health-monitoring programme should be established and all
       results documented, any incident should be investigated and its impact on the
       continuation of the animal and on previous batches of product should be
       determined. Care should be taken to ensure that any therapeutic products used
       to treat the animals do not contaminate the product.

3.     The genealogy of the founder animals through to production animals must be
       documented. Since a transgenic line will be derived from a single genetic founder
       animal, materials from different transgenic lines should not be mixed.

4.     The conditions under which the product is harvested should be in accordance
       with CTA or MA conditions. The harvest schedule and conditions under which
       animals may be removed from production should be performed according to
       approved procedures and acceptance limits.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -126-                           25 August 2023
Annex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use




B8.      TRANSGENIC PLANT PRODUCTS
         Consistency of starting material from a transgenic source is likely to be more
         problematic than is normally the case for non-transgenic biotechnology sources.
         Consequently, there is an increased requirement to demonstrate batch-to-batch
         consistency of product in all respects.

1.       Additional measures, over and above those given in Part A, may be required to
         prevent contamination of master and working transgenic banks by extraneous
         plant materials and relevant adventitious agents. The stability of the gene within
         defined generation numbers should be monitored.

2.       Plants should be clearly and uniquely identified, the presence of key plant
         features, including health status, across the crop should be verified at defined
         intervals through the cultivation period to assure consistency of yield between
         crops.

3.       Security arrangements for the protection of crops should be defined, wherever
         possible, such that they minimise the exposure to contamination by
         microbiological agents and cross-contamination with non-related plants.
         Measures should be in place to prevent materials such as pesticides and
         fertilisers from contaminating the product. A monitoring programme should be
         established and all results documented, any incident should be investigated and
         its impact on the continuation of the crop in the production programme should be
         determined.

4.       Conditions under which plants may be removed from production should be
         defined. Acceptance limits should be set for materials (e.g. host proteins) that
         may interfere with the purification process. It should be verified that the results
         are within approved limits.

5.       Environmental conditions (temperature, rain), which may affect the quality
         attributes and yield of the recombinant protein from time of planting, through
         cultivation to harvest and interim storage of harvested materials should be
         documented. The principles in documents such as ‘Guideline on Good
         Agricultural and Collection Practice for Starting Materials of Herbal Origin’31
         should be taken into account when drawing up such criteria.

ANNEX 3

      MANUFACTURE OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS


PRINCIPLE
     The manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals should be undertaken in accordance with
       the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products Part I and
       II. This annex specifically addresses some of the practices, which may be specific
       for radiopharmaceuticals.

     Note i. Preparation of radiopharmaceuticals in radiopharmacies (hospitals or certain
       pharmacies), using Generators and Kits with a marketing authorisation or a
       national licence, is not covered by this guideline, unless covered by national
       requirement.

     Note ii. According to radiation protection regulations it should be ensured that any
       medical exposure is under the clinical responsibility of a practitioner. In diagnostic
       and therapeutic nuclear medicine practices a medical physics expert should be
       available.

     Note iii. This annex is also applicable to radiopharmaceuticals used in clinical trials.

     Note iv. Transport of radiopharmaceuticals is regulated by the International Atomic
       Energy Association (IAEA) and radiation protection requirements.

     Note v. It is recognised that there are acceptable methods, other than those
       described in this annex, which are capable of achieving the principles of Quality
       Assurance. Other methods should be validated and provide a level of Quality
       Assurance at least equivalent to those set out in this annex.


INTRODUCTION
1.      The manufacturing and handling of radiopharmaceuticals is potentially
        hazardous. The level of risk depends in particular upon the types of radiation, the
        energy of radiation and the half-lives of radioactive isotopes. Particular attention
        must be paid to the prevention of cross-contamination, to the retention of
        radionuclide contaminants, and to waste disposal.

2.      Due to short shelf-life of their radionuclides, some radiopharmaceuticals may be
        released before completion of all quality control tests. In this case, the exact
        and detailed description of the whole release procedure including the
        responsibilities of the involved personnel and the continuous assessment of the
        effectiveness of the quality assurance system is essential.

3.      This guideline is applicable to manufacturing procedures employed by industrial
        manufacturers, Nuclear Centres/Institutes and PET Centres for the production
        and quality control of the following types of products:

            which GMP (part I or II) applies for the specific process/manufacturing steps.

    5.      Preparation of radiopharmaceuticals involves adherence to regulations on
            radiation protection.

    6.      Radiopharmaceuticals to be administered parenterally should comply with
            sterility requirements for parenterals and, where relevant, aseptic working
            conditions for the manufacture of sterile medicinal products, which are covered
            in PIC/S GMP Guide, Annex 1.

    7.      Specifications and quality control testing procedures for the most commonly used
            radiopharmaceuticals are specified in the European (or other relevant)
            Pharmacopoeia or in the marketing authorisation.

    Clinical Trials

    8.      Radiopharmaceuticals intended for use in clinical trials as investigational
            medicinal products should in addition be produced in accordance with the
            principles in PIC/S GMP Guide, Annex 13.


    QUALITY ASSURANCE
    9.      Quality assurance is of even greater importance in the manufacture of
            radiopharmaceuticals because of their particular characteristics, low volumes
            and in some circumstances the need to administer the product before testing is
            complete.

    10.     As with all pharmaceuticals, the products must be well protected against
            contamination and cross-contamination. However, the environment and the
            operators must also be protected against radiation. This means that the role of
            an effective quality assurance system is of the utmost importance.


     PE 009-17 (Annexes)                           -129-                           25 August 2023
                                       Annex 3    Manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals




11.    It is important that the data generated by the monitoring of premises and
       processes are rigorously recorded and evaluated as part of the release process.

12.    The principles of qualification and validation should be applied to the
       manufacturing of radiopharmaceuticals and a risk management approach should
       be used to determine the extent of qualification/validation, focusing on a
       combination of Good Manufacturing Practice and Radiation Protection.


PERSONNEL
13.    All manufacturing operations should be carried out under the responsibility of
       personnel with additional competence in radiation protection. Personnel involved
       in production, analytical control and release of radiopharmaceuticals should be
       appropriately trained in radiopharmaceutical specific aspects of the quality
       management system. The Authorised Person should have the overall
       responsibility for release of the products.

14..   All personnel (including those concerned with cleaning and maintenance)
       employed in areas where radioactive products are manufactured should receive
       additional training adapted to this class of products. .

15.    Where production facilities are shared with research institutions, the research
       personnel must be adequately trained in GMP regulations and the QA function
       must review and approve the research activities to ensure that they do not pose
       any hazard to the manufacturing of radiopharmaceuticals.


PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

General

16.    Radioactive products should be manufactured in controlled (environmental and
       radioactive) areas. All manufacturing steps should take place in self-contained
       facilities dedicated to radiopharmaceuticals

17.    Measures should be established and implemented to prevent cross-
       contamination from personnel, materials, radionuclides etc. Closed or contained
       equipment should be used whenever appropriate. Where open equipment is
       used, or equipment is opened, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk
       of contamination. The risk assessment should demonstrate that the
       environmental cleanliness level proposed is suitable for the type of product being
       manufactured.

18.    Access to the manufacturing areas should be via a gowning area and should be
       restricted to authorised personnel.

19.    Workstations and their environment should be monitored with respect to
       radioactivity, particulate and microbiological quality as established during
       performance qualification (PQ).



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -130-                           25 August 2023
                                         Annex 3      Manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals



20.    Preventive maintenance, calibration and qualification programmes should be
       operated to ensure that all facilities and equipment used in the manufacture of
       radiopharmaceutical are suitable and qualified. These activities should be carried
       out by competent personnel and records and logs should be maintained.

21.    Precautions should be taken to avoid radioactive contamination within the facility.
       Appropriate controls should be in place to detect any radioactive contamination,
       either directly through the use of radiation detectors or indirectly through a
       swabbing routine.

22.    Equipment should be constructed so that surfaces that come into contact with the
       product are not reactive, additive or absorptive so as to alter the quality of the
       radiopharmaceutical.

23.    Re-circulation of air extracted from area where radioactive products are handled
       should be avoided unless justified. Air outlets should be designed to minimize
       environmental contamination by radioactive particles and gases and appropriate
       measures should be taken to protect the controlled areas from particulate and
       microbial contamination.

24.    In order to contain radioactive particles, it may be necessary for the air pressure
       to be lower where products are exposed, compared with the surrounding areas.
       However, it is still necessary to protect the product from environmental
       contamination. This may be achieved by, for example, using barrier technology
       or airlocks, acting as pressure sinks.

Sterile production

25.    Sterile radiopharmaceuticals may be divided into those, which are manufactured
       aseptically, and those, which are terminally sterilised. The facility should maintain
       the appropriate level of environmental cleanliness for the type of operation being
       performed. For manufacture of sterile products the working zone where products
       or containers may be exposed to the environment, the cleanliness requirements
       should comply with the requirements described in the PIC/S GMP Guide,
       Annex 1.

26.    For manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals a risk assessment may be applied to
       determine the appropriate pressure differences, air flow direction and air quality.

27.    In case of use of closed and automated systems (chemical synthesis, purification,
       on-line sterile filtration) a grade C environment (usually “Hot-cell”) will be suitable.
       Hot-cells should meet a high degree of air cleanliness, with filtered feed air, when
       closed. Aseptic activities must be carried out in a grade A area.

28.    Prior to the start of manufacturing, assembly of sterilised equipment and
       consumables (tubing, sterilised filters and sterile closed and sealed vials to a
       sealed fluid path) must be performed under aseptic conditions

DOCUMENTATION
29.    All documents related to the manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals should be
       prepared, reviewed, approved and distributed according to written procedures.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -131-                            25 August 2023
                                        Annex 3      Manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals




30.    Specifications should be established and documented for raw materials, labelling
       and packaging materials, critical intermediates and the finished
       radiopharmaceutical. Specifications should also be in place for any other critical
       items used in the manufacturing process, such as process aids, gaskets, sterile
       filtering kits, that could critically impact on quality.

31.    Acceptance criteria should be established for the radiopharmaceutical including
       criteria for release and shelf life specifications (examples: chemical identity of the
       isotope, radioactive concentration, purity, and specific activity).

32.    Records of major equipment use, cleaning, sanitisation or sterilisation and
       maintenance should show the product name and batch number, where
       appropriate, in addition to the date and time and signature for the persons
       involved in these activities.

33.    Records should be retained for at least 3 years unless another timeframe is
       specified in national requirements.


PRODUCTION
34.    Production of different radioactive products in the same working area (i.e. hot-
       cell, LAF unit), at the same time should be avoided in order to minimise the risk
       of cross-contamination or mix-up.

35.    Special attention should be paid to validation including validation of computerised
       systems which should be carried out in accordance in compliance PIC/S GMP
       Guide, Annex 11. New manufacturing processes should be validated
       prospectively.

36.    The critical parameters should normally be identified before or during validation
       and the ranges necessary for reproducible operation should be defined.

37.    Integrity testing of the membrane filter should be performed for aseptically filled
       products, taking into account the need for radiation protection and maintenance
       of filter sterility.

38.    Due to radiation exposure it is accepted that most of the labelling of the direct
       container, is done prior to manufacturing. Sterile empty closed vials may be
       labelled with partial information prior to filling providing that this procedure does
       not compromise sterility or prevent visual control of the filled vial.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -132-                            25 August 2023
                                        Annex 3     Manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals



QUALITY CONTROL
39.     Some radiopharmaceuticals may have to be distributed and used on the basis of
        an assessment of batch documentation and before all chemical and microbiology
        tests have been completed.
        Radiopharmaceutical product release may be carried out in two or more stages,
        before and after full analytical testing:

        a) Assessment by a designated person of batch processing records, which should
        cover production conditions and analytical testing performed thus far, before
        allowing transportation of the radiopharmaceutical under quarantine status to the
        clinical department.

        b) Assessment of the final analytical data, ensuring all deviations from normal
        procedures are documented, justified and appropriately released prior to
        documented certification by the Authorised Person. Where certain test results are
        not available before use of the product, the Authorised Person should
        conditionally certify the product before it is used and should finally certify the
        product after all the test results are obtained.

40.     Most radiopharmaceuticals are intended for use within a short time and the period
        of validity with regard to the radioactive shelf-life, must be clearly stated.

41.     Radiopharmaceuticals having radionuclides with long half-lives should be tested
        to show, that they meet all relevant acceptance criteria before release and
        certification by the Authorised Person.

42.     Before testing is performed samples can be stored to allow sufficient radioactivity
        decay. All tests including the sterility test should be performed as soon as
        possible.

43.     A written procedure detailing the assessment of production and analytical data,
        which should be considered before the batch is dispatched, should be
        established.

44.     Products that fail to meet acceptance criteria should be rejected. If the material
        is reprocessed, pre-established procedures should be followed and the finished
        product should meet acceptance criteria before release. Returned products may
        not be reprocessed and must be stored as radioactive waste.

45.     A procedure should also describe the measures to be taken by Authorised
        Person if unsatisfactory test results (Out-of-Specification) are obtained after
        dispatch and before expiry. Such events should be investigated to include the
        relevant corrective and preventative actions taken to prevent future events.
      This process must be documented.

46.     Information should be given to the clinical responsible persons, if necessary. To
        facilitate this, a traceability system should be implemented for
        radiopharmaceuticals.

47.     A system to verify the quality of starting materials should be in place. Supplier
        approval should include an evaluation that provides adequate assurance that the



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -133-                          25 August 2023
                                      Annex 3     Manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals



       material consistently meets specifications. The starting materials, packaging
       materials and critical process aids should be purchased from approved suppliers.


REFERENCE AND RETENTION SAMPLES
48.    For radiopharmaceuticals sufficient samples of each batch of bulk formulated
       product should be retained for at least six months after expiry of the finished
       medicinal product unless otherwise justified through risk management.

49.    Samples of starting materials, other than solvents gases or water used in the
       manufacturing process should be retained for at least two years after the release
       of the product. That period may be shortened if the period of stability of the
       material as indicated in the relevant specification is shorter.

50.    Other conditions may be defined by agreement with the competent authority, for
       the sampling and retaining of starting materials and products manufactured
       individually or in small quantities or when their storage could raise special
       problems.


DISTRIBUTION
51.    Distribution of the finished product under controlled conditions, before all
       appropriate test results are available, is acceptable for radiopharmaceuticals,
       providing the product is not administered by the receiving institute until
       satisfactory test results has been received and assessed by a designated person.


GLOSSARY

ANNEX 4

          MANUFACTURE OF VETERINARY MEDICINAL
          PRODUCTS OTHER THAN IMMUNOLOGICALS



MANUFACTURE OF PREMIXES FOR MEDICATED FEEDING
STUFFS
For the purposes of these paragraphs,

-         a medicated feeding stuff is any mixture of a veterinary medicinal product or
          products and feed or feeds which is ready prepared for marketing and intended
          to be fed to animals without further processing because of its curative or
          preventative properties or other properties (e.g. medical diagnosis, restoration,
          correction or modification of physiological functions in animals):

-         a pre-mix for medicated feeding stuffs is any veterinary medicinal product
          prepared in advance with a view to the subsequent manufacture of medicated
          feeding stuffs.

1.        The manufacture of premixes for medicated feeding stuffs requires the use of
          large quantities of vegetable matter which is likely to attract insects and rodents.
          Premises should be designed, equipped and operated to minimize this risk (point
          3.4.) and should also be subject to a regular pest control programme.

2.        Because of the large volume of dust generated during the production of bulk
          material for premixes, specific attention should be given to the need to avoid
          cross contamination and facilitate cleaning (point 3.14), for example through the
          installation of sealed transport systems and dust extraction, whenever possible.
          The installation of such systems does not, however, eliminate the need for regular
          cleaning of production areas.

3.        Parts of the process likely to have a significant adverse influence on the stability
          of the active ingredients) (e.g. use of steam in pellet manufacture) should be
          carried out in an uniform manner from batch to batch.

4.        Consideration should be given to undertake the manufacture of premixes in
          dedicated areas which, if at all possible, do not form part of a main manufacturing
          plant. Alternatively, such dedicated areas should be surrounded by a buffer zone
          in order to minimize the risk of contamination of other manufacturing areas.




    PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -135-                           25 August 2023
      Annex 4    Manufacture of veterinary medicinal products other than immunologicals



THE MANUFACTURE OF ECTOPARASITICIDES
5.       In derogation from point 3.6, ectoparasiticides for external application to animals,
         which are veterinary medicinal products, and subject to marketing authorisation,
         may be produced and filled on a campaign basis in pesticide specific areas.
         However, other categories of veterinary medicinal products should not be
         produced in such areas.

6.       Adequate validated cleaning procedures should be employed to prevent cross
         contamination, and steps should be taken to ensure the secure storage of the
         veterinary medicinal product in accordance with the guide.


THE MANUFACTURE OF VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS
CONTAINING PENICILLINS
7.       The use of penicillins in veterinary medicine does not present the same risks of
         hypersensitivity in animals as in humans. Although incidents of hypersensitivity
         have been recorded in horses and dogs, there are other materials which are toxic
         to certain species, e.g. the ionophore antibiotics in horses. Although desirable,
         the requirements that such products be manufactured in dedicated,
         self-contained facilities (point 3.6) may be dispensed with in the case of facilities
         dedicated to the manufacture of veterinary medicinal products only. However, all
         necessary measures should be taken to avoid cross contamination and any risk
         to operator safety in accordance with the guide. In such circumstances,
         penicillin-containing products should be manufactured on a campaign basis and
         should be followed by appropriate, validated decontamination and cleaning
         procedures.


RETENTION OF SAMPLES (POINT 1.4. VIII AND POINT 6.14.)
8.       It is recognized that because of the large volume of certain veterinary medicinal
         products in their final packaging, in particular premixes, it may not be feasible for
         manufacturers to retain samples from each batch in its final packaging. However,
         manufacturers should ensure that sufficient representative samples of each
         batch are retained and stored in accordance with the guide.

9.       In all cases, the container used for storage should be composed of the same
         material as the market primary container in which the product is marketed.


STERILE VETERINARY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS
10.      Where this has been accepted by the competent authorities, terminally sterilized
         veterinary medicinal products may be manufactured in a clean area of a lower
         grade than the grade required in the annex on "Sterile preparations", but at least
         in a grade D environment.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                         -136-                           25 August 2023
                Annex 5     Manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products



ANNEX 5

     MANUFACTURE OF IMMUNOLOGICAL VETERINARY
               MEDICAL PRODUCTS


PRINCIPLE
       The manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products has special
       characteristics which should be taken into consideration when implementing and
       assessing the quality assurance system.

       Due to the large number of animal species and related pathogenic agents, the
       variety of products manufactured is very wide and the volume of manufacture is
       often low; hence, work on a campaign basis is common. Moreover, because of
       the very nature of this manufacture (cultivation steps, lack of terminal sterilization,
       etc.), the products must be particularly well protected against contamination and
       cross-contamination. The environment also must be protected especially when
       the manufacture involves the use of pathogenic or exotic biological agents and
       the worker must be particularly well protected when the manufacture involves the
       use of biological agents pathogenic to man.

       These factors, together with the inherent variability of immunological veterinary
       medicinal products and the relative inefficiency in particular of final product quality
       control tests in providing adequate information about products, means that the
       role of the quality assurance system is of the utmost importance. The need to
       maintain control over all of the following aspects of GMP, as well as those outlined
       in this Guide, cannot be overemphasized. In particular, it is important that the
       data generated by the monitoring of the various aspects of GMP (equipment,
       premises, product etc.) are rigorously assessed and informed decisions, leading
       to appropriate action, are made and recorded.


PERSONNEL
1.     All personnel (including those concerned with cleaning and maintenance)
       employed in areas where immunological products are manufactured should be
       given training in and information on hygiene and microbiology. They should
       receive additional training specific to the products with which they work.

2.     Responsible personnel should be formally trained in some or all of the following
       fields: bacteriology, biology, biometry, chemistry, immunology, medicine,
       parasitology, pharmacy, pharmacology, virology and veterinary medicine and
       should also have an adequate knowledge of environmental protection measures.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -137-                             25 August 2023
               Annex 5    Manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products



3.     Personnel should be protected against possible infection with the biological
       agents used in manufacture. In the case of biological agents known to cause
       disease in humans, adequate measures should be taken to prevent infection of
       personnel working with the agent or with experimental animals.

       Where relevant, the personnel should be vaccinated and subject to medical
       examination.

4.     Adequate measures should be taken to prevent biological agents being taken
       outside the manufacturing plant by personnel acting as a carrier. Dependent on
       the type of biological agent, such measures may include complete change of
       clothes and compulsory showering before leaving the production area.

5.     For immunological products, the risk of contamination or cross-contamination by
       personnel is particularly important.

       Prevention of contamination by personnel should be achieved by a set of
       measures and procedures to ensure that appropriate protective clothing is used
       during the different stages of the production process.

       Prevention of cross-contamination by personnel involved in production should be
       achieved by a set of measures and procedures to ensure that they do not pass
       from one area to another unless they have taken appropriate measures to
       eliminate the risk of contamination. In the course of a working day, personnel
       should not pass from areas where contamination with live microorganisms is
       likely or where animals are housed to premises where other products or
       organisms are handled. If such a passage is unavoidable, clearly defined
       decontamination procedures, including change of clothing and shoes, and, where
       necessary, showering, should be followed by staff involved in any such
       production.

       Personnel entering a contained area where organisms had not been handled in
       open circuit operations in the previous twelve hours to check on cultures in
       sealed, surface decontaminated flasks would not be regarded as being at risk of
       contamination, unless the organism involved was an exotic.


PREMISES
6.     Premises should be designed in such a way as to control both the risk to the
       product and to the environment.

       This can be achieved by the use of containment, clean, clean/contained or
       controlled areas.

7.     Live biological agents should be handled in contained areas. The level of
       containment should depend on the pathogenicity of the microorganism and
       whether it has been classified as exotic.

8.     Inactivated biological agents should be handled in clean areas. Clean areas
       should also be used when handling non-infected cells isolated from multicellular
       organisms and, in some cases, filtration-sterilized media.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                    -138-                          25 August 2023
               Annex 5     Manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products




9.     Open circuit operations involving products or components not subsequently
       sterilized should be carried out within a laminar air flow work station (grade A) in
       a grade B area.

10.    Other operations where live biological agents are handled (quality control,
       research and diagnostic services, etc.) should be appropriately, contained and
       separated if production operations are carried out in the same building. The level
       of containment should depend on the pathogenicity of the biological agent and
       whether they have been classified as exotic. Whenever diagnostic activities are
       carried out, there is the risk of introducing highly pathogenic organisms.
       Therefore, the level of containment should be adequate to cope with all such
       risks. Containment may also be required if quality control or other activities are
       carried out in buildings in close proximity to those used for production.

11.    Containment premises should be easily disinfected and should have the following
       characteristics:

       a)     The absence of direct venting to the outside;

       b)     a ventilation with air at negative pressure. Air should be extracted through
              HEPA filters and not be recirculated except to the same area, and
              provided further HEPA filtration is used (normally this condition would be
              met by routing the recirculated air through the normal supply HEPAs for
              that area). However, recycling of air between areas may be permissible
              provided that it passes through two exhaust HEPAs, the first of which is
              continuously monitored for integrity, and there are adequate measures for
              safe venting of exhaust air should this filter fail;

       c)     air from manufacturing areas used for the handling of exotic organisms
              should be vented through 2 sets of HEPA filters in series, and that from
              production areas not recirculated;

       d)     a system for the collection and disinfect ion of liquid effluents including
              contaminated condensate from sterilizers, biogenerators, etc. Solid
              wastes, including animal carcasses, should be disinfected, sterilized or
              incinerated as appropriate. Contaminated filters should be removed using
              a safe method;

       e)     changing rooms designed and used as air locks, and equipped with
              washing and showering facilities if appropriate. Air pressure differentials
              should be such that there is no flow of air between the work area and the
              external environment or risk of contamination of outer clothing worn
              outside the area;

       f)     an air lock system for the passage of equipment, which is constructed so
              that there is no flow of contaminated air between the work area and the
              external environment or risk of contamination of equipment within the
              lock. The air lock should be of a size which enables the effective surface
              decontamination of materials being passed through it. Consideration
              should be given to having a timing device on the door interlock to allow
              sufficient time for the decontamination process to be effective.

       g)     in many instances, a barrier double-door autoclave for the secure removal
              of waste materials and introduction of sterile items.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -139-                           25 August 2023
               Annex 5     Manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products



12.    Equipment passes and changing rooms should have an interlock mechanism or
       other appropriate system to prevent the opening of more than one door at a time.
       Changing rooms should be supplied with air filtered to the same standard as that
       for the work area, and extracts to produce an adequate air circulation
       independent of that of the work area. Equipment passes should normally be
       ventilated in the same way, but unventilated passes, or those equipped with
       supply air only, may be acceptable.

13.    Production operations such as cell maintenance, media preparation, virus
       culture, etc. likely to cause contamination should be performed in separate areas.
       Animals and animal products should be handled with appropriate precautions.

14.    Production areas where biological agents particularly resistant to disinfect ion
       (e.g. spore-forming bacteria) are handled should be separated and dedicated to
       that particular purpose until the biological agents have been inactivated.

15.    With the exception of blending and subsequent filling operations, one biological
       agent only should be handled at a time within an area.

16.    Production areas should be designed to permit disinfect ion between campaigns,
       using validated methods.

17.    Production of biological agents may take place in controlled areas provided it is
       carried out in totally enclosed and heat sterilized equipment, all connections
       being also heat sterilized after making and before breaking. it may be acceptable
       for connections to be made under local laminar air flow provided these are few in
       number and proper aseptic techniques are used and there is no risk of leakage.
       The sterilization parameters used before breaking the connections must be
       validated for the organisms being used. Different products may be placed in
       different biogenerators, within the same area, provided that there is no risk of
       accidental cross-contamination. However, organisms generally subject to special
       requirements for containment should be in areas dedicated to such products.

18.    Animal houses where animals intended or used for production are
       accommodated, should be provided with the appropriate containment and/or
       clean area measures, and should be separate from other animal accommodation.

       Animal houses where animals used for quality control, involving the use of
       pathogenic biological agents, are accommodated, should be adequately
       contained.

19.    Access to manufacturing areas should be restricted to authorised personnel.
       Clear and concise written procedures should be posted as appropriate.

20.    Documentation relating to the premises should be readily available in a plant
       master file.

       The manufacturing site and buildings should be described in sufficient detail (by
       means of plans and written explanations) so that the designation and conditions
       of use of all the rooms are correctly identified as well as the biological agents
       which are handled in them. The flow of people and product should also be clearly
       marked.

       The animal species accommodated in the animal houses or otherwise on the site
       should be identified.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -140-                           25 August 2023
                Annex 5     Manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products




       The activities carried out in the vicinity of the site should also be indicated.
       Plans of contained and/or clean area premises, should describe the ventilation
       system indicating inlets and outlets, filters and their specifications, the number of
       air changes per hour, and pressure gradients. They should indicate which
       pressure gradients are monitored by pressure indicator.


EQUIPMENT
21.    The equipment used should be designed and constructed so that it meets the
       particular requirements for the manufacture of each product.
       Before being put into operation the equipment should be qualified and validated
       and subsequently be regularly maintained and validated.
22.    Where appropriate, the equipment should ensure satisfactory primary
       containment of the biological agents.
       Where appropriate, the equipment should be designed and constructed as to
       allow easy and effective decontamination and/or sterilization.
23.    Closed equipment used for the primary containment of the biological agents
       should be designed and constructed as to prevent any leakage or the formation
       of droplets and aerosols.
       Inlets and outlets for gases should be protected so as to achieve adequate
       containment e.g. by the use of sterilizing hydrophobic filters.
       The introduction or removal of material should take place using a sterilizable
       closed system, or possibly in an appropriate laminar air flow.
24.    Equipment where necessary should be properly sterilized before use, preferably
       by pressurized dry steam. other methods can be accepted if steam sterilization
       cannot be used because of the nature of the equipment. It is important not to
       overlook such individual items as bench centrifuges and water baths.
       Equipment used for purification, separation or concentration should be sterilized
       or disinfected at least between use for different products. The effect of the
       sterilization methods on the effectiveness and validity of-the equipment should
       be studied in order to determine the life span of the equipment.
       All sterilization procedures should be validated.
25.    Equipment should be designed so as to prevent any mix-up between different
       organisms or products. Pipes, valves and filters should be identified as to their
       function.
       Separate incubators should be used for infected and non infected containers and
       also generally for different organisms or cells. Incubators containing more that
       one organism or cell type will only be acceptable if adequate steps are taken to
       seal, surface decontaminate and segregate the containers. Culture vessels, etc.
       should be individually labelled. The cleaning and disinfection of the items can be
       particularly difficult and should receive special attention.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -141-                            25 August 2023
               Annex 5     Manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products



       Equipment used for the storage of biological agents or products should be
       designed and used in such a manner as to prevent any possible mix-up. All stored
       items should be clearly and unambiguously labelled and in leak-proof containers.
       Items such as cells and organisms seed stock should be stored in dedicated
       equipment.

26.    Relevant equipment, such as that requiring temperature control, should be fitted
       with recording and/or alarm systems.

       To avoid breakdowns, a system of preventive maintenance, together with trend
       analyses of recorded data, should be implemented.

27.    The loading of freeze driers requires an appropriate clean/contained area.

       Unloading freeze driers contaminates the immediate environment. Therefore, for
       single-ended freeze driers, the clean room should be decontaminated before a
       further manufacturing batch is introduced into the area, unless this contains the
       same organisms, and double door freeze driers should be sterilized after each
       cycle unless opened in a clean area.

       Sterilization of freeze driers should be done in accordance with item 23. In case
       of campaign working, they should at least be sterilized after each campaign.


ANIMALS AND ANIMAL HOUSES
28.    ...

29.    Animal houses should be separated from the other production premises and
       suitably designed.

30.    The sanitary status of the animals used for production should be defined,
       monitored, and recorded. Some animals should be handled as defined in specific
       monographs (e.g. Specific Pathogens Free flocks).

31.    Animals, biological agents, and tests carried out should be the subject of an
       identification system so as to prevent any risk of confusion and to control all
       possible hazards.


DISINFECTION - WASTE DISPOSAL
32.    Disinfect ion and/or wastes and effluents disposal may be particularly important
       in the case of manufacture of immunological products. Careful consideration
       should therefore be given to procedures and equipment aiming at avoiding
       environmental contamination as well as to their validation and qualification.

PRODUCTION
33.    Because of the wide variety of products, the frequently large number of stages
       involved in the manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products and
       the nature of the biological processes, careful attention must be paid to


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -142-                          25 August 2023
                 Annex 5     Manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products



        adherence to validated operating procedures, to the constant monitoring of
        production at all stages and to in-process controls.

        Additionally, special consideration should be given to starting materials, media
        and the use of a seed lot system.


STARTING MATERIALS
34.     The suitability of starting materials should be clearly defined in written
        specifications. These should include details of the supplier, the method of
        manufacture, the geographical origin and the animal species from which the
        materials are derived. The controls to be applied to starting materials must be
        included. Microbiological controls are particularly important.

35.     The results of tests on starting materials must comply with the specifications.
        Where the tests take a long time (e.g. eggs from SPF flocks) it may be necessary
        to process starting materials before the results of analytical controls are available.
        In such cases, the release of a finished product is conditional upon satisfactory
        results of the tests on starting materials.

36.     Special attention should be paid to a knowledge of the supplier's quality
        assurance system in assessing the suitability of a source and the extent of quality
        control testing required.

37.     Where possible, heat is the preferred method for sterilizing starting materials. If
        necessary, other validated methods, such as irradiation, may be used.

Media

38.     The ability of media to support the desired growth should be properly validated in
        advance.

39.     Media should preferably be sterilized in situ or in line. Heat is the preferred
        method. Gases, media, acids, alkalis, defoaming agents and other materials
        introduced into sterile biogenerators should themselves be sterile.

Seed lot and cell bank system

40.     In order to prevent the unwanted drift of properties which might ensue from
        repeated subcultures or multiple generations, the production of immunological
        veterinary medicinal products obtained by microbial, cell or tissue culture, or
        propagation in embryos and animals, should be based on a system of seed lots
        and/or cell banks.

41.     The number of generations (doublings, passages) between the seed lot or cell
        bank and the finished product should be consistent with the dossier of
        authorisation for marketing.

42.     Seed lots and cell banks should be adequately characterized and tested for
        contaminants. Acceptance criteria for new seed lots should be established. Seed
        lots and cell banks should be established, stored and used in such a way as to



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -143-                            25 August 2023
               Annex 5      Manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products



       minimize the risks of contamination, or any alteration. During the establishment
       of the seed lot and cell bank, no other living or infectious material (e.g. virus or
       cell lines) should be handled simultaneously in the same area or by the same
       person.

43.    Establishment of the seed lot and cell bank should be performed in a suitable
       environment to protect the seed lot and the cell bank and, if applicable, the
       personnel handling it and the external environment.

44.    The origin, form and storage conditions of seed material should be described in
       full. Evidence of the stability and recovery of the seeds and banks should be
       provided. Storage containers should be hermetically sealed, clearly labelled and
       stored at an appropriate temperature. Storage conditions should be properly
       monitored. An inventory should be kept and each container accounted for.

45.    Only authorised personnel should be allowed to handle the material and this
       handling should be done under the supervision of a responsible person. Different
       seed lots or cell banks should be stored in such a way to avoid confusion or
       cross-contamination errors. It is desirable to split the seed lots and cell banks and
       to store the parts at different locations so as to minimize the risk of total loss.

Operating principles

46.    The formation of droplets and the production of foam should be avoided or
       minimized during manufacturing processes. centrifugation and blending
       procedures which can lead to droplet formation should be carried out in
       appropriate contained or clean/contained areas to prevent transfer of live
       organisms.

47.    Accidental spillages, especially of live organisms, must be dealt with quickly and
       safely. Validated decontamination measures should be available for each
       organism. Where different strains of single bacteria species or very similar
       viruses are involved, the process need be validated against only one of them,
       unless there is reason to believe that they may vary significantly in their
       resistance to the agent(s) involved.

48.    Operations involving the transfer of materials such as sterile media, cultures or
       product should be carried out in pre-sterilized closed systems wherever possible.
       Where this is not possible, transfer operations must be protected by laminar
       airflow work stations.

49.    Addition of media or cultures to biogenerators and other vessels should be
       carried out under carefully controlled conditions to ensure that contamination is
       not introduced. Care must be taken to ensure that vessels are correctly
       connected when addition of cultures takes place.

50.    When necessary, for instance when two or more fermentors are within a single
       area, sampling and addition ports, and connectors (after connection, before the
       flow of product, and again before disconnection) should be sterilized with steam.
       In other circumstances, chemical disinfection of ports and laminar air flow
       protection of connections may be acceptable.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -144-                           25 August 2023
               Annex 5     Manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products



51.    Equipment, glassware, the external surfaces of product containers and other
       such materials must be disinfected before transfer from a contained area using a
       validated method (see 47 above). Batch documentation can be a particular
       problem. only the absolute minimum required to allow operations to GMP
       standards should enter and leave the area. If obviously contaminated, such as
       by spills or aerosols, or if the organism involved is an exotic, the paperwork must
       be adequately disinfected through an equipment pass, or the information
       transferred out by such means as photocopy or fax.

52.    Liquid or solid wastes such as the debris after harvesting eggs, disposable culture
       bottles, unwanted cultures or biological agents, are best sterilized or disinfected
       before transfer from a contained area. However, alternatives such as sealed
       containers or piping may be appropriate in some cases.

53.    Articles and materials, including documentation, entering a production room
       should be carefully controlled to ensure that only materials concerned with
       production are introduced. There should be a system which ensures that
       materials entering a room are reconciled with those leaving so that accumulation
       of materials within the room does not occur.

54.    Heat stable articles and materials entering a clean area or clean/contained area
       should do so through a double-ended autoclave or oven. Heat labile articles and
       materials should enter through an airlock with interlocked doors where they are
       disinfected. Sterilization of articles and materials elsewhere is acceptable
       provided that they are double wrapped and enter through an airlock with the
       appropriate precautions.

55.    Precautions must be taken to avoid contamination or confusion during incubation.
       There should be a cleaning and disinfection procedure for incubators. Containers
       in incubators should be carefully and clearly labelled.

56.    With the exception of blending and subsequent filling operations (or when totally
       enclosed systems are used) only one live biological agent may be handled within
       a production room at any given time. Production rooms must be effectively
       disinfected between the handling of different live biological agents.

57.    Products should be inactivated by the addition of inactivant accompanied by
       sufficient agitation. The mixture should then be transferred to a second sterile
       vessel, unless the container is of such a size and shape as to be easily inverted
       and shaken so as to wet all internal surfaces with the final culture/ inactivant
       mixture.

58.    Vessels containing inactivated product should not be opened or sampled in areas
       containing live biological agents. All subsequent processing of inactivated
       products should take place in clean areas grade A-B or enclosed equipment
       dedicated to inactivated products.

59.    Careful consideration should be given to the validation of methods for
       sterilization, disinfection, virus removal and inactivation.

60.    Filling should be carried out as soon as possible following production. Containers
       of bulk product prior to filling should be sealed, appropriately labelled and stored
       under specified conditions of temperature.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -145-                           25 August 2023
               Annex 5     Manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products




61.    There should be a system to assure the integrity and closure of containers after
       filling.

62.    The capping of vials containing live biological agents must be performed in such
       a way that ensures that contamination of other products or escape of the live
       agents into other areas or the external environment does not occur.

63.    For various reasons there may be a delay between the filling of final containers
       and their labelling and packaging. Procedures should be specified for the storage
       of unlabelled containers in order to prevent confusion and to ensure satisfactory
       storage conditions. Special attention should be paid to the storage of heat labile
       or photosensitive products. Storage temperatures should be specified.

64.    For each stage of production, the yield of product should be reconciled with that
       expected from that process. Any significant discrepancies should be investigated.


QUALITY CONTROL

65.    In-process controls play a specially important role in ensuring the consistency of
       the quality of biological medicinal products. Those controls which are crucial for
       the quality (e.g. virus removal) but which cannot be carried out on the finished
       product, should be performed at an appropriate stage of production.

66.    It may be necessary to retain samples of intermediate products in sufficient
       amount and under appropriate storage conditions to allow repetition or
       confirmation of a batch control.

67.    There may be a requirement for the continuous monitoring of data during a
       production process, for example monitoring of physical parameters during
       fermentation.

68.    Continuous culture of biological products is a common practice and special
       consideration needs to be given to the quality control requirements arising from
       this type of production method.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -146-                           25 August 2023
                                             Annex 6     Manufacture of medicinal gases




ANNEX 6

            MANUFACTURE OF MEDICINAL GASES

PRINCIPLE
       This Annex deals with the manufacture of active substance gases and the
       manufacture of medicinal gases.

       The delineation between the manufacture of the active substance and the
       manufacture of the medicinal product should be clearly defined in each Marketing
       Authorisation dossier. Normally, the production and purification steps of the gas
       belong to the field of manufacture of active substances. Gases enter the
       pharmaceutical field from the first storage of gas intended for such use.

       Manufacture of active substance gases should comply with the Basic
       Requirements of this Guide (Part II), with the relevant part of this Annex, and with
       the other Annexes of the Guide if relevant.

       Manufacture of medicinal gases should comply with the basic requirements of
       this Guide (Part I), with the relevant part of this Annex and with the other Annexes
       of the Guide if relevant.

       In the exceptional cases of continuous processes where no intermediate storage
       of gas between the manufacture of the active substance and the manufacture of
       the medicinal product is possible, the whole process (from starting materials of
       active substance to medicinal finished product) should be considered as
       belonging to the pharmaceutical field. This should be clearly stated in the
       Marketing Authorisation dossier.

       The Annex does not cover the manufacture and handling of medicinal gases in
       hospitals unless this is considered industrial preparation or manufacturing.
       However, relevant parts of this Annex may be used as a basis for such activities.

       Manufacture of active substance gases

       Active substance gases can be prepared by chemical synthesis or be obtained
       from natural sources followed by purification steps, if necessary (as for example
       in an air separation plant).

1.     The processes corresponding to these two methods of manufacturing active
       substance gases should comply with Part II of the Basic Requirements. However:

       (a) the requirements regarding starting materials for active substances (Part II,
           Chapter 7) do not apply to the production of active substance gases by air
           separation (however, the manufacturer should ensure that the quality of
           ambient air is suitable for the established process and any changes in the
           quality of ambient air do not affect the quality of the active substance gas);


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -147-                           25 August 2023
                                             Annex 6     Manufacture of medicinal gases




       (b) the requirements regarding on-going stability studies (Part II, Chapter 11.5),
           which are used to confirm storage conditions and expiry/retest dates (Part II,
           Chapter 11.6), do not apply in case initial stability studies have been replaced
           by bibliographic data; and

       (c) the requirements regarding reserve/retention samples (Part II, Chapter 11.7)
           do not apply to active substance gases, unless otherwise specified.

2.     The production of active substance gases through a continuous process (e.g. air
       separation) should be continuously monitored for quality. The results of this
       monitoring should be kept in a manner permitting trend evaluation.

3.     In addition:

       (a) transfers and deliveries of active substance gases in bulk should comply with
           the same requirements as those mentioned below for the medicinal gases
           (sections 19 to 21 of this Annex);

       (b) filling of active substance gases into cylinders or into mobile cryogenic
           vessels should comply with the same requirements as those mentioned
           below for the medicinal gases (sections 22 to 37 of this Annex) as well as
           Part II Chapter 9.

       Manufacture of medicinal gases

       Manufacture of medicinal gases is generally carried out in closed equipment.
       Consequently, environmental contamination of the product is minimal. However,
       risks of contamination (or cross contamination with other gases) may arise, in
       particular because of the reuse of containers.

4.     Requirements applying to cylinders should also apply to cylinders bundles
       (except storage and transportation under cover).


PERSONNEL
5.     All personnel involved in the manufacture and distribution of medicinal gases
       should receive an appropriate GMP training applying to this type of products.
       They should be aware of the critically important aspects and potential hazards
       for patients from these products.

6.     Personnel of subcontractors that could influence the quality of medicinal gases
       (such as personnel in charge of maintenance of cylinders or valves) should be
       appropriately trained.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -148-                           25 August 2023
                                             Annex 6      Manufacture of medicinal gases



PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT
       Premises

7.     Cylinders and mobile cryogenic vessels should be checked, prepared, filled and
       stored in a separate area from non-medicinal gases, and there should be no
       exchange of cylinders/mobile cryogenic vessels between these areas. However,
       it could be accepted to check, prepare, fill and store other gases in the same
       areas, provided they comply with the specifications of medicinal gases and that
       the manufacturing operations are performed according to GMP standards.

8.     Premises should provide sufficient space for manufacturing, testing and storage
       operations to avoid the risk of mix-up. Premises should be designated to provide:

       a) separate marked areas for different gases;

       b) clear identification and segregation of cylinders/mobile cryogenic vessels at
          various stages of processing (e.g. “waiting checking”, "awaiting filling",
          "quarantine", "certified", “rejected “,“prepared deliveries”).

       The method used to achieve these various levels of segregation will depend on
       the nature, extent and complexity of the overall operation. Marked-out floor areas,
       partitions, barriers, signs, labels or other appropriate means could be used.

9.     Empty cylinders/home cryogenic vessels after sorting or maintenance, and filled
       cylinders/home cryogenic vessels should be stored under cover, protected from
       adverse weather conditions. Filled cylinders/mobile cryogenic vessels should be
       stored in a manner that ensures that they will be delivered in a clean state,
       compatible with the environment in which they will be used.

10.    Specific storage conditions should be provided as required by the Marketing
       Authorisation (e.g. for gas mixtures where phase separation occurs on freezing).

       Equipment

11.    Equipment should be designed to ensure the correct gas is filled into the correct
       container. There should normally be no cross connections between pipelines
       carrying different gases. If cross connections are needed (e.g. filling equipment
       of mixtures), qualification should ensure that there is no risk of cross
       contamination between the different gases. In addition, the manifolds should be
       equipped with specific connections. These connections may be subject to
       international or national standards. The use of connections meeting different
       standards at the same filling site should be carefully controlled, as well as the use
       of adaptors needed in some situations to bypass the specific fill connection
       systems.

12.    Tanks and tankers should be dedicated to a single and defined quality of gas.
       However, medicinal gases may be stored or transported in the same tanks, other
       containers used for intermediate storage, or tankers, as the same non-medicinal
       gas, provided that the quality of the latter is at least equal to the quality of the
       medicinal gas and that GMP standards are maintained. In such cases, quality
       risk management should be performed and documented.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -149-                           25 August 2023
                                              Annex 6     Manufacture of medicinal gases




13.    A common system supplying gas to medicinal and non-medicinal gas manifolds
       is only acceptable if there is a validated method to prevent backflow from the non-
       medicinal gas line to the medicinal gas line.

14.    Filling manifolds should be dedicated to a single medicinal gas or to a given
       mixture of medicinal gases. In exceptional cases, filling gases used for other
       medical purposes on manifolds dedicated to medicinal gases may be acceptable
       if justified and performed under control. In these cases, the quality of the non-
       medicinal gas should be at least equal to the required quality of the medicinal gas
       and GMP standards should be maintained. Filling should then be carried out by
       campaigns.

15.    Repair and maintenance operations (including cleaning and purging) of
       equipment, should not adversely affect the quality of the medicinal gases. In
       particular, procedures should describe the measures to be taken after repair and
       maintenance operations involving breaches of the system’s integrity. Specifically
       it should be demonstrated that the equipment is free from any contamination that
       may adversely affect the quality of the finished product before releasing it for use.
       Records should be maintained.

16.    A procedure should describe the measures to be taken when a tanker is back
       into medicinal gas service (after transporting non-medicinal gas in the conditions
       mentioned in section 12, or after a maintenance operation). This should include
       analytical testing.


DOCUMENTATION
17.    Data included in the records for each batch of cylinders / mobile cryogenic
       vessels must ensure that each filled cylinder is traceable to significant aspects of
       the relevant filling operations. As appropriate, the following should be entered:

       a) the name of the product;
       b) batch number;
       c)   the date and the time of the filling operations;
       d) identification of the person(s) carrying out each significant step (e.g. line

                                              Annex 6      Manufacture of medicinal gases



       l)   specification of the finished product and results of quality control tests
            (including reference to the calibration status of the test equipment);
       m) quantity of rejected cylinders/mobile cryogenic vessels, with individual

       n) details of any problems or unusual events, and signed authorisation for any
          deviation from filling instructions; and
       o) certification statement by the Authorised Person, date and signature.

18.    Records should be maintained for each batch of gas intended to be delivered into
       hospital tanks. These records should, as appropriate, include the following (items
       to be recorded may vary depending on local legislation):

       a) name of the product;
       b) batch number;
       c)   identification reference for the tank (tanker) in which the batch is certified;
       d) date and time of the filling operation;
       e) identification of the person(s) carrying out the filling of the tank (tanker);
       f)   reference to the supplying tanker (tank), reference to the source gas as
            applicable;

            deviation from filling instructions; and
       j)   certification statement by the Authorised Person, date and signature.


PRODUCTION
       Transfers and deliveries of cryogenic and liquefied gas

19.    The transfers of cryogenic or liquefied gases from primary storage, including
       controls before transfers, should be in accordance with validated procedures
       designed to avoid any contamination. Transfer lines should be equipped with
       non-return valves or other suitable alternatives. Flexible connections, and
       coupling hoses and connectors should be flushed with the relevant gas before
       use.

20.    The transfer hoses used to fill tanks and tankers should be equipped with
       product-specific connections. The use of adaptors allowing the connection of
       tanks and tankers not dedicated to the same gases should be adequately
       controlled.

21.    Deliveries of gas may be added to tanks containing the same quality of gas
       provided that a sample is tested to ensure that the quality of the delivered gas is




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -151-                           25 August 2023
                                                Annex 6     Manufacture of medicinal gases



          acceptable. This sample may be taken from the gas to be delivered or from the
          receiving tank after delivery.

          Note: See specific arrangements in section 42 for filling of tanks retained by
          customers at the customer’s premises.

          Filling and labelling of cylinders and mobile cryogenic vessels

22.       Before filling cylinders and mobile cryogenic vessels, a batch (batches) of gas(es)
          should be determined, controlled according to specifications and approved for
          filling.

23.       In the case of continuous processes as those mentioned in ‘Principle’, there
          should be adequate in-process controls to ensure that the gas complies with
          specifications.

24.       Cylinders, mobile cryogenic vessels and valves should conform to appropriate
          technical specifications and any relevant requirements of the Marketing
          Authorisation. They should be dedicated to a single medicinal gas or to a given
          mixture of medicinal gases. Cylinders should be colour-coded according to
          relevant standards. They should preferably be fitted with minimum pressure
          retention valves with non-return mechanism in order to get adequate protection
          against contamination.

25.       Cylinders, mobile cryogenic vessels and valves should be checked before first
          use in production, and should be properly maintained. Where medical devices
          have gone through a conformity assessment procedure1, the maintenance should
          address the medical device manufacturer’s instructions.

26.       Checks and maintenance operations should not affect the quality and the safety
          of the medicinal product. The water used for the hydrostatic pressure testing
          carried out on cylinders should be at least of drinking quality.

27.       As part of the checks and maintenance operations, cylinders should be subject
          to an internal visual inspection before fitting the valve, to make sure they are not
          contaminated with water or other contaminants. This should be done:

             when they are new and initially put into medicinal gas service;
             following any hydrostatic statutory pressure test or equivalent test where the
              valve is removed;
             whenever the valve is replaced.

          After fitting, the valve should be kept closed to prevent any contamination from
          entering the cylinder. If there is any doubt about the internal condition of the
          cylinder, the valve should be removed and the cylinder internally inspected to
          ensure it has not been contaminated.

28.       Maintenance and repair operations of cylinders, mobile cryogenic vessels and
          valves are the responsibility of the manufacturer of the medicinal product. If


1
       In the EU/EEA, these devices are marked «CE».


    PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -152-                           25 August 2023
                                             Annex 6       Manufacture of medicinal gases



       subcontracted, they should only be carried out by approved subcontractors, and
       contracts including technical agreements should be established. Subcontractors
       should be audited to ensure that appropriate standards are maintained.

29.    There should be a system in place to ensure traceability of cylinders, mobile
       cryogenic vessels and valves.

30.    Checks to be performed before filling should include:
      a)   in the case of cylinders, a check, carried out according to defined procedure,
           to ensure there is a positive residual pressure in each cylinder;
            if the cylinder is fitted with a minimum pressure retention valve, when
             there is no signal indicating there is a positive residual pressure, the
             correct functioning of the valve should be checked, and if the valve is
             shown not to function properly the cylinder should be sent to
             maintenance,
            if the cylinder is not fitted with a minimum pressure retention valve, when
             there is no positive residual pressure the cylinder should be put aside for
             additional measures, to make sure it is not contaminated with water or
             other contaminants; additional measures could consist of internal visual
             inspection followed by cleaning using a validated method;

      b)   a check to ensure that all previous batch labels have been removed;

      c)   a check that any damaged product labels have been removed and replaced;

      d)   a visual external inspection of each cylinder, mobile cryogenic vessel and
           valve for dents, arc burns, debris, other damage and contamination with oil
           or grease; cleaning should be done if necessary;

      e)   a check of each cylinder or mobile cryogenic vessel outlet connection to
           determine that it is the proper type for the particular gas involved;

      f)   a check of the date of the next test to be performed on the valve (in the case
           of valves that need to be periodically tested);

      g)   a check of the cylinders or mobile cryogenic vessels to ensure that any tests
           required by national or international regulations (e.g. hydrostatic pressure
           test or equivalent for cylinders) have been conducted and still is valid; and

      h)   a check to determine that each container is colour-coded as specified in the
           Marketing Authorisation (colour-coding of the relevant national / international
           standards).

31.    A batch should be defined for filling operations.

32.    Cylinders which have been returned for refilling should be prepared with care in
       order to minimise risks for contamination in line with the procedures defined in
       the Marketing Authorisation. These procedures, which should include evacuation
       and/or purging operations, should be validated.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -153-                           25 August 2023
                                             Annex 6      Manufacture of medicinal gases



       Note: For compressed gases a maximum theoretical impurity of 500 ppm v/v
       should be obtained for a filling pressure of 200 bar at 15°C (and equivalent for
       other filling pressures).

33.    Mobile cryogenic vessels that have been returned for refilling should be prepared
       with care in order to minimise the risks of contamination, in line with the
       procedures defined in the Marketing Authorisation. In particular, mobile vessels
       with no residual pressure should be prepared using a validated method.

34.    There should be appropriate checks to ensure that each cylinder/mobile
       cryogenic vessel has been properly filled.

35.    Each filled cylinder should be tested for leaks using an appropriate method, prior
       to fitting the tamperevident seal or device (see section 36). The test method
       should not introduce any contaminant into the valve outlet and, if applicable,
       should be performed after any quality sample is taken.

36.    After filling, cylinders valves should be fitted with covers to protect the outlets
       from contamination. Cylinders and mobile cryogenic vessels should be fitted with
       tamper-evident seals or devices.

37.    Each cylinder or mobile cryogenic vessel should be labelled. The batch number
       and the expiry date may be on a separate label.

38.    In the case of medicinal gases produced by mixing two or more different gases
       (in-line before filling or directly into the cylinders); the mixing process should be
       validated to ensure that the gases are properly mixed in every cylinder and that
       the mixture is homogeneous.


QUALITY CONTROL
39.    Each batch of medicinal gas (cylinders, mobile cryogenic vessels, hospital tanks)
       should be tested in accordance with the requirements of the Marketing
       Authorisation and certified.

40.    Unless different provisions are required in the Marketing Authorisation, the
       sampling plan and the analysis to be performed should comply, in the case of
       cylinders with the following requirements.

       a) In the case of a single medicinal gas filled via a multi-cylinder manifold, the
          gas from at least one cylinder from each manifold filling cycle should be tested
          for identity and assay each time the cylinders are changed on the manifold.

       b) In the case of a single medicinal gas filled put into cylinders one at a time, the
          gas from at least one cylinder of each uninterrupted filling cycle should be
          tested for identity and assay. An example of an uninterrupted filling cycle is
          one shift's production using the same personnel, equipment, and batch of gas
          to be filled.

       c) In the case of a medicinal gas produced by mixing two or more gases in a
          cylinder from the same manifold, the gas from every cylinder should be tested



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -154-                           25 August 2023
                                              Annex 6     Manufacture of medicinal gases



           for assay and identity of each component gas. For excipients, if any, testing
           on identity could be performed on one cylinder per manifold filling cycle (or
           per uninterrupted filling cycle in case of cylinders filled one at a time). Fewer
           cylinders may be tested in case of validated automated filling system.

       d) Premixed gases should follow the same principles as single gases when
          continuous in-line testing of the mixture to be filled is performed.

           Premixed gases should follow the same principle as medicinal gases
           produced by mixing gases in the cylinders when there is no continuous in-line
           testing of the mixture to be filled.

       Testing for water content should be performed unless otherwise justified.

       Other sampling and testing procedures that provide at least equivalent level of
       quality assurance may be justified

41.    Unless different provisions are required in the Marketing Authorisation, final
       testing on mobile cryogenic vessels should include a test for assay and identity
       on each vessel. Testing by batches should only be carried out if it has been
       demonstrated that the critical attributes of the gas remaining in each vessel
       before refilling have been maintained.

42.    Cryogenic vessels retained by customers (hospital tanks or home cryogenic
       vessels), which are refilled in place from dedicated tankers do not need to be
       sampled after filling, provided that a certificate of analysis on the contents of the
       tanker accompanies the delivery. However, it should be demonstrated that the
       specification of the gas in the vessels is maintained over the successive refillings.

43.    Reference and retention samples are not required, unless otherwise specified.

44.    On-going stability studies are not required in case initial stability studies have
       been replaced by bibliographic data.


TRANSPORTATION OF PACKAGED GASES
45.    Filled gas cylinders and home cryogenic vessels should be protected during
       transportation so that, in particular, they are delivered to customers in a clean
       state compatible with the environment in which they will be used.

ANNEX 7

    MANUFACTURE OF HERBAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS


PRINCIPLE
          Because of their often complex and variable nature, control of starting materials,
          storage and processing assume particular importance in the manufacture of
          herbal medicinal products.

          The “starting material” in the manufacture of an herbal medicinal product1 can be
          a medicinal plant, an herbal substance2 or an herbal preparation1. The herbal
          substance should be of suitable quality and supporting data should be provided
          to the manufacturer of the herbal preparation/herbal medicinal product. Ensuring
          consistent quality of the herbal substance may require more detailed information
          on its agricultural production. The selection of seeds, cultivation and harvesting
          conditions represent important aspects of the quality of the herbal substance and
          can influence the consistency of the finished product. Recommendations on an
          appropriate quality assurance system for good agricultural and collection practice
          are provided in national or international guidance documents on Good
          Agricultural and Collection Practice for starting materials of herbal origin3.

          This Annex applies to all herbal starting materials: medicinal plants, herbal
          substances or herbal preparations.

          Explanatory Notes
          †
           ..The GMP classification of the herbal material is dependent upon the use made
          of it by the manufacturing authorisation holder. The material may be classified as
          an active substance, an intermediate or a finished product. It is the responsibility
          of the manufacturer of the medicinal product to ensure that the appropriate GMP
          classification is applied.

          * Manufacturers should ensure that these steps are carried out in accordance
          with the marketing authorisation / registration. For those initial steps that take
          place in the field, as justified in the marketing authorisation / registration, the
          national or international standards of Good Agricultural and Collection Practice
          for starting materials of herbal origin (GACP)# are applicable. GMP is applicable
          to further cutting and drying steps.

          ** Regarding the expression from plants and distillation, if it is necessary for
          these activities to be an integral part of harvesting to maintain the quality of the
          product within the approved specifications, it is acceptable that they are
          performed in the field, provided that the cultivation is in compliance with national
          or international standards of GACP#. These circumstances should be regarded
          as exceptional and justified in the relevant marketing authorisation / registration
          documentation. For activities carried out in the field, appropriate documentation,
          control, and validation according to the GMP principles should be assured.
          Regulatory authorities may carry out GMP inspections of these activities in order
          to assess compliance.

                                      Annex 7    Manufacture of herbal medicinal products



PREMISES
Storage areas

1.        Herbal substances should be stored in separate areas. The storage area should
          be equipped in such a way as to give protection against the entry of insects or
          other animals, especially rodents. Effective measures should be taken to prevent
          the spread of any such animals and micro-organisms brought in with the crude
          substance, to prevent fermentation or mould growth and to prevent cross-
          contamination. Different enclosed areas should be used to quarantine incoming
          herbal substances and for the approved herbal substances.

2.        The storage area should be well aerated and the containers should be located in
          such a way as to allow free circulation of air.

3.        Special attention should be paid to the cleanliness and good maintenance of the
          storage areas particularly when dust is generated.

4.        Storage of herbal substances and herbal preparations may require special
          conditions of humidity, temperature or light protection; these conditions should
          be provided and monitored.

Production area

5.        Specific provisions should be made during sampling, weighing, mixing and
          processing operations of herbal substances and herbal preparations whenever
          dust is generated, to facilitate cleaning and to avoid cross-contamination, as for
          example, dust extraction, dedicated premises, etc.

Equipment

6.        The equipment, filtering materials etc. used in the manufacturing process must
          be compatible with the extraction solvent, in order to prevent any release or
          undesirable absorption of substance that could affect the product.


DOCUMENTATION
Specifications for starting materials

7.        Herbal medicinal product manufacturers must ensure that they use only herbal
          starting materials manufactured in accordance with GMP and the Marketing
          Authorisation dossier. Comprehensive documentation on audits of the herbal
          starting material suppliers carried out by, or on behalf of the herbal medicinal
          product manufacturer should be made available. Audit trails for the active
          substance are fundamental to the quality of the starting material. The
          manufacturer should verify, where appropriate, whether the suppliers of the
          herbal substance / preparation are in compliance with Good Agricultural and
          Collection Practice5 and – if not – apply appropriate controls in line with Quality
          Risk Management (QRM).

8.     To fulfil the specification requirements described in the basic requirements of the
       Guide (Chapter 4), documentation for herbal substances / preparations should
       include:

        the binomial scientific name of plant (genus, species, subspecies / variety and
         author (e.g. Linnaeus); other relevant information such as the cultivar name
         and the chemotype should also be provided, as appropriate;
        details of the source of the plant (country or region of origin and where
         applicable, cultivation, time of harvesting, collection procedures, possible
         pesticides used, possible radioactive contamination, etc.);
        which part(s) of the plant is/are used;
        when a dried plant is used, the drying system should be specified;
        a description of the herbal substance and its macro and microscopic
         examination;
        suitable identification tests including, where appropriate, identification tests
         for constituents with known therapeutic activity, or markers. Specific
         distinctive tests are required where an herbal substance is liable to be
         adulterated / substituted. A reference authentic specimen should be available
         for identification purposes;
        the water content for herbal substances, determined in accordance with the
         relevant Pharmacopoeia;
        assay of constituents of known therapeutic activity or, where appropriate, of
         markers; the methods suitable to determine possible pesticide contamination

         in absence of thereof, with an appropriate validated method, unless otherwise
         justified;
        tests to determine fungal and/or microbial contamination, including aflatoxins,
         other mycotoxins, pest-infestations and limits accepted, as appropriate;
        tests for toxic metals and for likely contaminants and adulterants, as
         appropriate;
        tests for foreign materials, as appropriate;
        any other additional test according to the relevant Pharmacopoeia general
         monograph on herbal substances or to the specific monograph of the herbal
         substance, as appropriate.

       Any treatment used to reduce fungal/microbial contamination or other infestation
       should be documented. Specifications and procedures should be available and
       should include details of process, tests and limits for residues.

                                   Annex 7     Manufacture of herbal medicinal products



Processing instructions

9.     The processing instructions should describe the different operations carried out
       upon the herbal substance such as cleaning, drying, crushing and sifting, and
       include drying time and temperatures, and methods used to control cut size or
       particle size.

10.    In particular, there should be written instructions and records, which ensure that
       each container of herbal substance is carefully examined to detect any
       adulteration/substitution or presence of foreign matter, such as metal or glass
       pieces, animal parts or excrement, stones, sand, etc., or rot and signs of decay.

11.    The processing instructions should also describe security sieving or other
       methods of removing foreign materials and appropriate procedures for
       cleaning/selection of plant material before the storage of the approved herbal
       substance or before the start of manufacturing.

12.    For the production of an herbal preparation, instructions should include details of
       solvent, time and temperatures of extraction, details of any concentration stages
       and methods used.


QUALITY CONTROL
Sampling

13.    Due to the fact that medicinal plant/herbal substances are heterogeneous in
       nature, their sampling should be carried out with special care by personnel with
       particular expertise. Each batch should be identified by its own documentation.

14.    A reference sample of the plant material is necessary, especially in those cases
       where the herbal substance is not described in the relevant Pharmacopoeia.
       Samples of unmilled plant material are required if powders are used.

15.    Quality Control personnel should have particular expertise and experience in
       herbal substances, herbal preparations and/or herbal medicinal products in order
       to be able to carry out identification tests and recognise adulteration, the
       presence of fungal growth, infestations, non-uniformity within a delivery of crude
       material, etc.

16.    The identity and quality of herbal substances, herbal preparations and herbal
       medicinal products should be determined in accordance with the relevant current
       national or international guidance on quality and specifications of herbal
       medicinal products and traditional herbal medicinal products and, where relevant,
       to specific pharmacopoeial monographs.

 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -162-                          25 August 2023
                               Annex 8      Sampling of starting and packaging materials



ANNEX 8

        SAMPLING OF STARTING AND PACKAGING
                     MATERIALS


PRINCIPLE
       Sampling is an important operation in which only a small fraction of a batch is
       taken. Valid conclusions on the whole cannot be based on tests which have been
       carried out on non-representative samples. Correct sampling is thus an essential
       part of a system of Quality Assurance.

       Note: Sampling is dealt with in Chapter 6 of the Guide to GMP, items 6.11 to
             6.14. These supplementary guidelines give additional guidance on the
             sampling of starting and packaging materials.


PERSONNEL
1.     Personnel who take samples should receive initial and on-going regular training
       in the disciplines relevant to correct sampling. This training should include:
        sampling plans,
        written sampling procedures,
        the techniques and equipment for sampling,
        the risks of cross-contamination,
        the precautions to be taken with regard to unstable and/or sterile substances,
        the importance of considering the visual appearance of materials, containers
         and labels,
        the importance of recording any unexpected or unusual circumstances.


STARTING MATERIALS
2.     The identity of a complete batch of starting materials can normally only be
       ensured if individual samples are taken from all the containers and an identity
       test performed on each sample. It is permissible to sample only a proportion of
       the containers where a validated procedure has been established to ensure that
       no single container of starting material will be incorrectly identified on its label.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -163-                           25 August 2023
                               Annex 8     Sampling of starting and packaging materials



3.     This validation should take account of at least the following aspects:
        nature and status of the manufacturer and of the supplier and their
         understanding of the GMP requirements of the Pharmaceutical Industry;
        the Quality Assurance system of the manufacturer of the starting material;
        the manufacturing conditions under which the starting material is produced
         and controlled;
        the nature of the starting material and the medicinal products in which it will
         be used.

       Under such arrangements, it is possible that a validated procedure exempting
       identity testing of each incoming container of starting material could be accepted
       for:
        starting materials coming from a single product manufacturer or plant;
        starting materials coming directly from a manufacturer or in the
         manufacturer's sealed container where there is a history of reliability and
         regular audits of the manufacturer's Quality Assurance system are conducted
         by the purchaser (the manufacturer of the medicinal products or by an
         officially accredited body.

       It is improbable that a procedure could be satisfactorily validated for:
        starting materials supplied by intermediaries such as brokers where the
         source of manufacture is unknown or not audited;
        starting materials for use in parenteral products.

4.     The quality of a batch of starting materials may be assessed by taking and testing
       a representative sample. The samples taken for identity testing could be used for
       this purpose. The number of samples taken for the preparation of a
       representative sample should be determined statistically and specified in a
       sampling plan. The number of individual samples which may be blended to form
       a composite sample should also be defined, taking into account the nature of the
       material, knowledge of the supplier and the homogeneity of the composite
       sample.


PACKAGING MATERIAL
5.     The sampling plan for packaging materials should take account of at least the
       following: the quantity received, the quality required, the nature of the material
       (e.g. primary packaging materials and/or printed packaging materials), the
       production methods, and the knowledge of Quality Assurance system of the
       packaging materials manufacturer based on audits. The number of samples
       taken should be determined statistically and specified in a sampling plan.

ANNEX 9

        MANUFACTURE OF LIQUIDS, CREAMS AND
                   OINTMENTS


PRINCIPLE
       Liquids, creams and ointments may be particularly susceptible to microbial and
       other contamination during manufacture. Therefore special measures must be
       taken to prevent any contamination.

       Note: The manufacture of liquids, creams and ointments must be done in
             accordance with the GMP described in the PIC Guide to GMP and with
             the other supplementary guidelines, where applicable. The present
             guidelines only stress points which are specific to this manufacture.


PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT
1.     The use of closed systems of processing and transfer is recommended in order
       to protect the product from contamination. Production areas where the products
       or open clean containers are exposed should normally be effectively ventilated
       with filtered air.

2.     Tanks, containers, pipework and pumps should be designed and installed so that
       they may be readily cleaned and if necessary sanitised. In particular, equipment
       design should include a minimum of dead-legs or sites where residues can
       accumulate and promote microbial proliferation.

3.     The use of glass apparatus should be avoided wherever possible. High quality
       stainless steel is often the material of choice for product contact parts.


PRODUCTION
4.     The chemical and microbiological quality of water used in production should be
       specified and monitored. Care should be taken in the maintenance of water
       systems in order to avoid the risk of microbial proliferation. After any chemical
       sanitization of the water systems, a validated flushing procedure should be
       followed to ensure that the sanitising agent has been effectively removed.

5.     The quality of materials received in bulk tankers should be checked before they
       are transferred to bulk storage tanks.

6.     Care should be taken when transferring materials via pipelines to ensure that
       they are delivered to their correct destination.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -165-                          25 August 2023
                              Annex 9    Manufacture of liquids, creams and ointments



7.     Materials likely to shed fibres or other contaminants, like cardboard or wooden
       pallets, should not enter the areas where products or clean containers are
       exposed.

8.     Care should be taken to maintain the homogeneity of mixtures, suspensions, etc.
       during filling. Mixing and filling processes should be validated. Special care
       should be taken at the beginning of a filling process, after stoppages and at the
       end of the process to ensure that homogeneity is maintained.

9.     When the finished product is not immediately packaged, the maximum period of
       storage and the storage conditions should be specified and respected.

     Annex 10    Manufacture of pressurised metered dose aerosol preparations for inhalation



ANNEX 10

     MANUFACTURE OF PRESSURISED METERED DOSE
       AEROSOL PREPARATIONS FOR INHALATION


PRINCIPLE
        Manufacture of pressurised aerosol products for inhalation with metering valves
        requires some special provisions arising from the particular nature of this
        pharmaceutical form. It should occur under conditions which minimise microbial and
        particulate contamination. Assurance of the quality of the valve components and, in
        the case of suspensions, of uniformity is also of particular importance.

        Note: The manufacture of metered dose aerosols must be done in accordance with
              the GMP described in the PIC Guide to GMP and with the other
              supplementary guidelines, where applicable. The present guidelines only
              stress points which are specific to this manufacture.


GENERAL
1.      There are presently two common manufacturing and filling methods as follows:

        a)      Two-shot system (pressure filling). The active ingredient is suspended in a
                high boiling point propellant, the dose is filled into the container, the valve is
                crimped on and the lower boiling point propellant is injected through the valve
                stem to make up the finished product. The suspension of active ingredient in
                propellant is kept cool to reduce evaporation loss.

        b)      One-shot process (cold filling). The active ingredient is suspended in a
                mixture of propellants and held either under high pressure and/or at a low
                temperature. The suspension is then filled directly into the container in one
                shot.


PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT
2.      Manufacture and filling should be carried out as far as possible in a closed system.

3.      Where products or clean components are exposed, the area should be fed with
        filtered air, should comply with the requirements of at least a Grade D environment
        and should be entered through airlocks.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -167-                            25 August 2023
 Annex 10    Manufacture of pressurised metered dose aerosol preparations for inhalation



PRODUCTION AND QUALITY CONTROL
4.     Metering valves for aerosols are a more complex engineering article than most
       pharmaceutical components. Specifications, sampling and testing should be
       appropriate for this situation. Auditing the Quality Assurance system of the valve
       manufacturer is of particular importance.

5.     All fluids (e.g. liquid or gaseous propellants) should be filtered to remove particles
       greater than 0.2 micron. An additional filtration where possible immediately before
       filling is desirable.

6.     Containers and valves should be cleaned using a validated procedure appropriate
       to the use of the product to ensure the absence of any contaminants such as
       fabrication aids (e.g. lubricants) or undue microbiological contaminants. After
       cleaning, valves should be kept in clean, closed containers and precautions taken
       not to introduce contamination during subsequent handling, e.g. taking samples.
       Containers should be provided to the filling line in a clean condition or cleaned on
       line immediately before filling.

7.     Precautions should be taken to ensure uniformity of suspensions at the point of fill
       throughout the filling process.

8.     When a two-shot filling process is used, it is necessary to ensure that both shots are
       of the correct weight in order to achieve the correct composition. For this purpose,
       100% weight checking at each stage is often desirable.

9.     Controls after filling should ensure the absence of undue leakage. Any leakage test
       should be performed in a way which avoids microbial contamination or residual
       moisture.

                                                      Annex 11     Computerised systems



ANNEX 11

                       COMPUTERISED SYSTEMS


PRINCIPLE
       This annex applies to all forms of computerised systems used as part of a GMP
       regulated activities. A computerised system is a set of software and hardware
       components which together fulfil certain functionalities.

       The application should be validated; IT infrastructure should be qualified.

       Where a computerised system replaces a manual operation, there should be no
       resultant decrease in product quality, process control or quality assurance. There
       should be no increase in the overall risk of the process.



GENERAL

1.     Risk Management

       Risk management should be applied throughout the lifecycle of the computerised
       system taking into account patient safety, data integrity and product quality. As
       part of a risk management system, decisions on the extent of validation and data
       integrity controls should be based on a justified and documented risk assessment
       of the computerised system.

2.     Personnel

       There should be close cooperation between all relevant personnel such as
       Process Owner, System Owner, Authorised Persons and IT. All personnel should
       have appropriate qualifications, level of access and defined responsibilities to
       carry out their assigned duties.

3.     Suppliers and Service Providers

3.1    When third parties (e.g. suppliers, service providers) are used e.g. to provide,
       install, configure, integrate, validate, maintain (e.g. via remote access), modify or
       retain a computerised system or related service or for data processing, formal
       agreements must exist between the manufacturer and any third parties, and
       these agreements should include clear statements of the responsibilities of the
       third party. IT-departments should be considered analogous.
3.2    The competence and reliability of a supplier are key factors when selecting a
       product or service provider. The need for an audit should be based on a risk
       assessment.

3.3    Documentation supplied with commercial off-the-shelf products should be
       reviewed by regulated users to check that user requirements are fulfilled.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -169-                           25 August 2023
                                                      Annex 11     Computerised systems




3.4    Quality system and audit information relating to suppliers or developers of
       software and implemented systems should be made available to inspectors on
       request.


PROJECT PHASE
4.     Validation

4.1    The validation documentation and reports should cover the relevant steps of the
       life cycle. Manufacturers should be able to justify their standards, protocols,
       acceptance criteria, procedures and records based on their risk assessment.

4.2    Validation documentation should include change control records (if applicable)
       and reports on any deviations observed during the validation process.

4.3    An up to date listing of all relevant systems and their GMP functionality (inventory)
       should be available.

       For critical systems an up-to-date system description detailing the physical and
       logical arrangements, data flows and interfaces with other systems or processes,
       any hardware and software pre-requisites, and security measures should be
       available.

4.4    User Requirements Specifications should describe the required functions of the
       computerised system and be based on documented risk assessment and GMP
       impact. User requirements should be traceable throughout the life-cycle.

4.5    The regulated user should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the system
       has been developed in accordance with an appropriate quality management
       system. The supplier should be assessed appropriately.

4.6    For the validation of bespoke or customised computerised systems there should
       be a process in place that ensures the formal assessment and reporting of quality
       and performance measures for all the life-cycle stages of the system.

4.7    Evidence of appropriate test methods and test scenarios should be
       demonstrated. Particularly, system (process) parameter limits, data limits and
       error handling should be considered. Automated testing tools and test
       environments should have documented assessments for their adequacy.

4.8    If data are transferred to another data format or system, validation should include
       checks that data are not altered in value and/or meaning during this migration
       process.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -170-                           25 August 2023
                                                     Annex 11      Computerised systems



OPERATIONAL PHASE

5.     Data

       Computerised systems exchanging data electronically with other systems should
       include appropriate built-in checks for the correct and secure entry and
       processing of data, in order to minimize the risks.

6.     Accuracy Checks

       For critical data entered manually, there should be an additional check on the
       accuracy of the data. This check may be done by a second operator or by
       validated electronic means. The criticality and the potential consequences of
       erroneous or incorrectly entered data to a system should be covered by risk
       management.

7.     Data Storage

7.1    Data should be secured by both physical and electronic means against damage.
       Stored data should be checked for accessibility, readability and accuracy. Access
       to data should be ensured throughout the retention period.

7.2    Regular back-ups of all relevant data should be done. Integrity and accuracy of
       backup data and the ability to restore the data should be checked during
       validation and monitored periodically.

8.     Printouts

8.1    It should be possible to obtain clear printed copies of electronically stored data.

8.2    For records supporting batch release it should be possible to generate printouts
       indicating if any of the data has been changed since the original entry.

9.     Audit Trails

       Consideration should be given, based on a risk assessment, to building into the
       system the creation of a record of all GMP-relevant changes and deletions (a
       system generated "audit trail"). For change or deletion of GMP-relevant data the
       reason should be documented. Audit trails need to be available and convertible
       to a generally intelligible form and regularly reviewed.

10.    Change and Configuration Management

       Any changes to a computerised system including system configurations should
       only be made in a controlled manner in accordance with a defined procedure.

11.    Periodic Evaluation

       Computerised systems should be periodically evaluated to confirm that they
       remain in a valid state and are compliant with GMP. Such evaluations should
       include, where appropriate, the current range of functionality, deviation records,




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -171-                           25 August 2023
                                                    Annex 11      Computerised systems



       incidents, problems, upgrade history, performance, reliability, security and
       validation status reports.

12.    Security

12.1   Physical and/or logical controls should be in place to restrict access to
       computerised system to authorised persons. Suitable methods of preventing
       unauthorised entry to the system may include the use of keys, pass cards,
       personal codes with passwords, biometrics, restricted access to computer
       equipment and data storage areas.

12.2   The extent of security controls depends on the criticality of the computerised
       system.

12.3   Creation, change, and cancellation of access authorisations should be recorded.

12.4   Management systems for data and for documents should be designed to record
       the identity of operators entering, changing, confirming or deleting data including
       date and time.

13.    Incident Management

       All incidents, not only system failures and data errors, should be reported and
       assessed. The root cause of a critical incident should be identified and should
       form the basis of corrective and preventive actions.

14.    Electronic Signature

       Electronic records may be signed electronically. Electronic signatures are
       expected to:

       a. have the same impact as hand-written signatures within the boundaries of the
          company,
       b. be permanently linked to their respective record,
       c. include the time and date that they were applied.

15.    Batch release

       When a computerised system is used for recording certification and batch
       release, the system should allow only Authorised Persons to certify the release
       of the batches and it should clearly identify and record the person releasing or
       certifying the batches. This should be performed using an electronic signature.

16.    Business Continuity

       For the availability of computerised systems supporting critical processes,
       provisions should be made to ensure continuity of support for those processes in
       the event of a system breakdown (e.g. a manual or alternative system). The time
       required to bring the alternative arrangements into use should be based on risk
       and appropriate for a particular system and the business process it supports.
       These arrangements should be adequately documented and tested.

17.    Archiving

       Data may be archived. This data should be checked for accessibility, readability
       and integrity. If relevant changes are to be made to the system (e.g. computer
       equipment or programs), then the ability to retrieve the data should be ensured
       and tested.

         Annex 12      Use of ionising radiation in the manufacture of medicinal products



ANNEX 12

 USE OF IONISING RADIATION IN THE MANUFACTURE
             OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS


INTRODUCTION
       Ionising radiation may be used during the manufacturing process for various
       purposes including the reduction of bioburden and the sterilisation of starting
       materials, packaging components or products and the treatment of blood
       products.

       There are two types of irradiation process: Gamma irradiation from a radioactive
       source and high energy Electron irradiation (Beta radiation) from an accelerator.

       Gamma irradiation: two different processing modes may be employed:

       (i)    Batch mode: the products is arranged at fixed locations around the
              radiation source and cannot be loaded or unloaded while the radiation
              source is exposed.

       (ii)   Continuous mode: an automatic system conveys the products into the
              radiation cell, past the exposed radiation source along a defined path and
              at an appropriate speed, and out of the cell.

       Electron irradiation: the product is conveyed past a continuous or pulsed beam
       of high energy electrons (Beta radiation) which is scanned back and forth across
       the product pathway.


RESPONSIBILITIES
1.     Treatment by irradiation may be carried out by the pharmaceutical manufacturer
       or by an operator of a radiation facility under contract (a "contract manufacturer"),
       both of whom must hold an appropriate manufacturing authorisation.

2.     The pharmaceutical manufacturer bears responsibility for the quality of the
       product including the attainment of the objective of irradiation. The contract
       operator of the radiation facility bears responsibility for ensuring that the dose of
       radiation required by the manufacturer is delivered to the irradiation container (i.e.
       the outermost container in which the products are irradiated).

3.     The required dose including justified limits will be stated in the marketing
       authorisation for the product.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -174-                            25 August 2023
         Annex 12      Use of ionising radiation in the manufacture of medicinal products



DOSIMETRY
4.     Dosimetry is defined as the measurement of the absorbed dose by the use of
       dosimeters. Both understanding and correct use of the technique is essential for
       the validation, commissioning and control of the process.

5.     The calibration of each batch of routine dosimeters should be traceable to a
       national or international standard. The period of validity of the calibration should
       be stated, justified and adhered to.

6.     The same instrument should normally be used to establish the calibration curve
       of the routine dosimeters and to measure the change in their absorbance after
       irradiation. If a different instrument is used, the absolute absorbance of each
       instrument should be established.

7.     Depending on the type of dosimeter used, due account should be taken of
       possible causes of inaccuracy including the change in moisture content, change
       in temperature, time elapsed between irradiation and measurement, and the dose
       rate.

8.     The wavelength of the instrument used to measure the change in absorbance of
       dosimeters and the instrument used to measure their thickness should be subject
       to regular checks of calibration at intervals established on the basis of stability,
       purpose and usage.


VALIDATION OF THE PROCESS
9.     Validation is the action of proving that the process, i.e. the delivery of the intended
       absorbed dose to the product, will achieve the expected results. The
       requirements for validation are given more fully in the note for guidance on "the
       use of ionising radiation in the manufacture of medicinal products".

10.    Validation should include dose mapping to establish the distribution of absorbed
       dose within the irradiation container when packed with product in a defined
       configuration.

11.    An irradiation process specification should include at least the following:

       a)      details of the packaging of the product;

       b)      the loading pattern(s) of product within the irradiation container. Particular
               care needs to be taken, when a mixture of products is allowed in the
               irradiation container, that there is no underdosing of dense product or
               shadowing of other products by dense product. Each mixed product
               arrangement must be specified and validated;

       c)      the loading pattern of irradiation containers around the source (batch
               mode) or the pathway through the cell (continuous mode);

       d)      maximum and minimum limits of absorbed dose to the product [and
               associated routine dosimetry];



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -175-                             25 August 2023
            Annex 12     Use of ionising radiation in the manufacture of medicinal products



       e)       maximum and minimum limits of absorbed dose to the irradiation
                container and associated routine dosimetry to monitor this absorbed
                dose;

       f)       other process parameters, including dose rate, maximum time of
                exposure, number of exposures, etc.

       When irradiation is supplied under contract at least parts (d) and (e) of the
       irradiation process specification should form part of that contract.


COMMISSIONING OF THE PLANT
General

12.    Commissioning is the exercise of obtaining and documenting evidence that the
       irradiation plant will perform consistently within predetermined limits when
       operated according to the process specification. In the context of this annex,
       predetermined limits are the maximum and minimum doses designed to be
       absorbed by the irradiation container. It must not be possible for variations to
       occur in the operation of the plant which give a dose to the container outside
       these limits without the knowledge of the operator.

13.    Commissioning should include the following elements:

       a.       Design
       b.       Dose mapping;
       c.       Documentation;
       d.       Requirement for re-commissioning.

Gamma irradiators

       Design

14.    The absorbed dose received by a particular part of an irradiation container at any
       specific point in the irradiator depends primarily on the following factors:

       a)       the activity and geometry of the source;
       b)       the distance from source to container;
       c)       the duration of irradiation controlled by the timer setting or conveyor
                speed;
       d)       the composition and density of material, including other products,
                between the source and the particular part of the container.

15.    The total absorbed dose will in addition depend on the path of containers through
       a continuous irradiator or the loading pattern in a batch irradiator, and on the
       number of exposure cycles.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -176-                          25 August 2023
        Annex 12       Use of ionising radiation in the manufacture of medicinal products



16.    For a continuous irradiator with a fixed path or a batch irradiator with a fixed
       loading pattern, and with a given source strength and type of product, the key
       plant parameter controlled by the operator is conveyor speed or timer setting.

       Dose Mapping

17.    For the dose mapping procedure, the irradiator should be filled with irradiation
       containers packed with dummy products or a representative product of uniform
       density. Dosimeters should be placed throughout a minimum of three loaded
       irradiation containers which are passed through the irradiator, surrounded by
       similar containers or dummy products. If the product is not uniformly packed,
       dosimeters should be placed in a larger number of containers.

18.    The positioning of dosimeters will depend on the size of the irradiation container.
       For example, for containers up to 1 x 1 x 0.5 m, a three-dimensional 20 cm grid
       throughout the container including the outside surfaces might be suitable. If the
       expected positions of the minimum and maximum dose are known from a
       previous irradiator performance characterisation, some dosimeters could be
       removed from regions of average dose and replaced to form a 10 cm grid in the
       regions of extreme dose.

19.    The results of this procedure will give minimum and maximum absorbed doses
       in the product and on the container surface for a given set of plant parameters,
       product density and loading pattern.

20.    Ideally, reference dosimeters should be used for the dose mapping exercise
       because of their greater precision. Routine dosimeters are permissible but it is
       advisable to place reference dosimeters beside them at the expected positions
       of minimum and maximum dose and at the routine monitoring position in each of
       the replicate irradiation containers. The observed values of dose will have an
       associated random uncertainty which can be estimated from the variations in
       replicate measurements.

21.    The minimum observed dose, as measured by the routine dosimeters, necessary
       to ensure that all irradiation containers receive the minimum required dose will
       be set in the knowledge of the random variability of the routine dosimeters used.

22.    Irradiator parameters should be kept constant, monitored and recorded during
       dose mapping. The records, together with the dosimetry results and all other
       records generated, should be retained.

Electron Beam Irradiators
       Design

23.    The absorbed dose received by a particular portion of an irradiated product
       depends primarily on the following factors:

       a)     the characteristics of the beam, which are: electron energy, average
              beam current, scan width and scan uniformity;

       b)     the conveyor speed;

       c)     the product composition and density;



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -177-                          25 August 2023
        Annex 12       Use of ionising radiation in the manufacture of medicinal products



       d)     the composition, density and thickness of material between the output
              window and the particular portion of product;

       e)     the output window to container distance.

24.    Key parameters controlled by the operator are the characteristics of the beam
       and the conveyor speed.

       Dose Mapping

25.    For the dose mapping procedure, dosimeters should be placed between layers
       of homogeneous absorber sheets making up a dummy product, or between
       layers of representative products of uniform density, such that at least ten
       measurements can be made within the maximum range of the electrons.
       Reference should also be made to sections 18 to 21.

26.    Irradiator parameters should be kept constant, monitored and recorded during
       dose mapping. The records, together with the dosimetry results and all other
       records generated, should be retained.

       Re-commissioning

27.    Commissioning should be repeated if there is a change to the process or the
       irradiator which could affect the dose distribution to the irradiation container (e.g.
       change of source pencils). The extent to re-commissioning depends on the extent
       of the change in the irradiator or the load that has taken place. If in doubt, re-
       commission.


PREMISES
28.    Premises should be designed and operated to segregate irradiated from non-
       irradiated containers to avoid their cross-contamination. Where materials are
       handled within closed irradiation containers, it may not be necessary to segregate
       pharmaceutical from non-pharmaceutical materials, provided there is no risk of
       the former being contaminated by the latter.

       Any possibility of contamination of the products by radionuclide from the source
       must be excluded.


PROCESSING
29.    Irradiation containers should be packed in accordance with the specified loading
       pattern(s) established during validation.

30.    During the process, the radiation dose to the irradiation containers should be
       monitored using validated dosimetry procedures. The relationship between this
       dose and the dose absorbed by the product inside the container must have been
       established during process validation and plant commissioning.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -178-                            25 August 2023
        Annex 12       Use of ionising radiation in the manufacture of medicinal products



31.    Radiation indicators should be used as an aid to differentiating irradiated from
       non-irradiated containers. They should not be used as the sole means of
       differentiation or as an indication of satisfactory processing.

32.    Processing of mixed loads of containers within the irradiation cell should only be
       done when it is known from commissioning trials or other evidence that the
       radiation dose received by individual containers remains within the limits
       specified.

33.    When the required radiation dose is by design given during more than one
       exposure or passage through the plant, this should be with the agreement of the
       holder of the marketing authorisation and occur within a predetermined time
       period. Unplanned interruptions during irradiation should be notified to the holder
       of the marketing authorisation if this extends the irradiation process beyond a
       previously agreed period.

34.    Non-irradiated products must be segregated from irradiated products at all times.
       Methods or doing this include the use of radiation indicators (31.) and appropriate
       design of premises (28.).

Gamma irradiators

35.    For continuous processing modes, dosimeters should be placed so that at least
       two are exposed in the irradiation at all times.

36.    For batch modes, at least two dosimeters should be exposed in positions related
       to the minimum dose position.

37.    For continuous process modes, there should be a positive indication of the
       correct position of the source and an interlock between source position and
       conveyor movement. Conveyor speed should be monitored continuously and
       recorded.

38.    For batch process modes source movement and exposure times for each batch
       should be monitored and recorded.

39.    For a given desired dose, the timer setting or conveyor speed requires
       adjustment for source decay and source additions. The period of validity of the
       setting or speed should be recorded and adhered to.

Electron Beam Irradiators

40.    A dosimeter should be placed on every container.

41.    There should be continuous recording of average beam current, electron energy,
       scan-width and conveyor speed. These variables, other than conveyor speed,
       need to be controlled within the defined limits established during commissioning
       since they are liable to instantaneous change.

DOCUMENTATION
42.    The numbers of containers received, irradiated and dispatched should be
       reconciled with each other and with the associated documentation. Any
       discrepancy should be reported and resolved.

43.    The irradiation plant operator should certify in writing the range of doses received
       by each irradiated container within a batch or delivery.

44.    Process and control records for each irradiation batch should be checked and
       signed by a nominated responsible person and retained. The method and place
       or retention should be agreed between the plant operator and the holder of the
       marketing authorisation.

45.    The documentation associated with the validation and commissioning of the plant
       should be retained for one year after the expiry date or at least five years after
       the release of the last product processed by the plant, whichever is the longer.


MICROBIOLOGICAL MONITORING
46.    Microbiological monitoring is the responsibility of the pharmaceutical
       manufacturer. It may include environmental monitoring where product is
       manufactured and pre-irradiation monitoring of the product as specified in the
       marketing authorisation.

ANNEX 13

           MANUFACTURE OF INVESTIGATIONAL
                MEDICINAL PRODUCTS


INTRODUCTION
      These guidelines lay down appropriate tools to address specific issues
      concerning investigational medicinal products with regard to good manufacturing
      practice. The tools are flexible to provide for changes as knowledge of the
      process increases and appropriate to the stage of development of the product.

      An investigational medicinal product is a pharmaceutical form of an active
      substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial,
      including a product with a marketing authorisation when used or assembled
      (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorised form, or when
      used for an unauthorised indication, or when used to gain further information
      about the authorised form.

      Unless otherwise defined in national law, manufacturing is defined as total and
      partial manufacture, as well as the various processes of dividing up, packaging
      and labelling (including blinding).

      Investigational medicinal products shall be manufactured by applying
      manufacturing practices which ensure the quality of such medicinal products in
      order to safeguard the safety of the subject and the reliability and robustness of
      clinical data generated in the clinical trial ("good manufacturing practice").

      The good manufacturing practice requirements for investigational medicinal
      products are set out in these guidelines. Various other parts of the PIC/S GMP
      Guide provide useful guidance also and they should be considered.

      Procedures need to be flexible to provide for changes as knowledge of the
      process increases and appropriate to the stage of development of the products.

      In clinical trials there may be added risk to the subjects compared to patients
      treated with authorised medicinal products. The application of good
      manufacturing practice for the manufacture and import of investigational
      medicinal products is intended to ensure that subjects are not placed at undue
      risk, and that the results of clinical trials are unaffected by inadequate quality,
      safety or efficacy arising from unsatisfactory manufacture or import. (Note: the
      reference to ‘Import’ here and in other parts of this annex refers to importation
      activities into the relevant country, which should be performed in accordance with
      applicable national laws/requirements.) Equally, it is intended to ensure that there
      is consistency between batches of the same investigational medicinal product
      used in the same or different clinical trials and that changes during the
      development of an investigational medicinal product are adequately documented
      and justified.



PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -181-                           25 August 2023
                         Annex 13     Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



      The production of investigational medicinal products involves added complexity
      in comparison with authorised medicinal products by virtue of lack of fixed
      routines, variety of clinical trial designs and consequent packaging designs.
      Randomisation and blinding add to that complexity an increased risk of product
      cross-contamination and mix-up. Furthermore, there may be incomplete
      knowledge of the potency and toxicity of the product and a lack of full process
      validation. Moreover, authorised products may be used which have been re-
      packaged or modified in some way. These challenges require personnel with a
      thorough understanding of and training in the application of good manufacturing
      practice to investigational medicinal products. The increased complexity in
      manufacturing operations requires a highly effective quality system.

      For manufacturers to be able to apply and comply with good manufacturing
      practice for investigational medicinal products, co-operation between
      manufacturers and sponsors of clinical trials is required. This co-operation should
      be described in a technical agreement between the sponsor and manufacturer.


1.    SCOPE
      These guidelines apply to manufacture or import of investigational medicinal
      products for human use.

      Reconstitution of investigational medicinal products is not considered
      manufacturing, unless otherwise subject to national law, and therefore is not
      covered by this guideline.

      The reconstitution is understood as the simple process of dissolving or dispersing
      the investigational medicinal product for administration of the product to a trial
      subject, or diluting or mixing the investigation medicinal product with some other
      substance(s) used as a vehicle for the purpose of administering it to a trial
      subject.

      Reconstitution is not mixing several ingredients, including the active substance,
      together to produce the investigational medicinal product. An investigational
      medicinal product must exist before a process can be defined as reconstitution.

      The process of reconstitution has to be undertaken as close in time as possible
      to administration and has to be defined in the clinical trial application dossier and
      document available at the clinical trial site.

      While these guidelines do not apply to the activities listed below, PIC/S
      Participating Authorities should, in accordance with national law, make those
      processes subject to appropriate and proportionate requirements to ensure
      subject safety and reliability and robustness of the data generated in the clinical
      trial:

            Re-labelling or re-packaging, where those processes are carried out in
             hospitals, health centres or clinics, by pharmacists or other persons legally
             authorised in the country concerned to carry out such processes, and if
             the investigational medicinal products are intended to be used exclusively
             in hospitals, health centres or clinics taking part in the same clinical trial
             in the same country;


PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -182-                           25 August 2023
                         Annex 13     Manufacture of investigational medicinal products




            The preparation of radiopharmaceuticals used as diagnostic
             investigational medicinal products where this process is carried out in
             hospitals, health centres or clinics, by pharmacists or other persons legally
             authorised in the country concerned to carry out such processes, and
             where the investigational medicinal products are intended to be used
             exclusively in hospitals, health centres or clinics taking part in the same
             clinical trial in the same country;

            The preparation of medicinal products for use as investigational medicinal
             products, where this process is carried out in hospitals, health centres or
             clinics legally authorised in the country concerned to carry out such
             process and where the investigational medicinal products are intended to
             be used exclusively in hospitals, health centres or clinics taking part in the
             same clinical trial in the same country.


2.    PHARMACEUTICAL QUALITY SYSTEM
      The pharmaceutical quality system which is designed, set-up and verified by the
      manufacturer should be described in written procedures, taking into account the
      guidance in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of the PIC/S GMP Guide, as applicable, to
      investigational medicinal products.

      The product specifications and manufacturing instructions may be changed
      during development, but full control and traceability of the changes should be
      documented and maintained. Deviations from any predefined specifications and
      instructions should be registered, investigated and corrective and preventive
      action measures initiated as appropriate.

      The selection, qualification, approval and maintenance of suppliers of starting
      materials, together with their purchase and acceptance, should be documented
      as part of the pharmaceutical quality system to ensure the integrity of the supply
      chain and protect against falsified products. The level of supervision should be
      proportionate to the risks posed by the individual materials, taking into account
      their source, manufacturing process, supply chain complexity and the final use to
      which the material is put in the investigational medicinal product. The supporting
      evidence for each supplier approval and material approval should be documented
      and maintained.

2.1. Product specification file
      1. The product specification file brings together and contains all of the essential
         reference documents to ensure that investigational medicinal products are
         manufactured according to good manufacturing practice for investigational
         medicinal products and the clinical trial authorisation. The product
         specification file is one of the essential elements of the pharmaceutical quality
         system.

      2. Applicable sections of the product specification file should be available at the
         start of manufacturing of the first batch of the investigational medicinal
         product for use in a clinical trial.


PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -183-                            25 August 2023
                          Annex 13    Manufacture of investigational medicinal products




      3. The product specification file should be continually updated as development
         of the product proceeds, ensuring appropriate traceability to the previous
         versions. It should include, or refer to, at least the following documents:

           i.      specifications and analytical methods for starting materials,
                   packaging materials, intermediate product, bulk product and finished
                   product;
           ii.     manufacturing methods;
           iii.    in-process testing and methods;
           iv.     approved label copy;
           v.      relevant clinical trial authorisations and amendments thereof, clinical
                   trial protocol and randomisation codes, as appropriate;
           vi.     relevant technical agreements with contract givers and acceptors,
                   as appropriate;
           vii.    stability plan and reports;
           viii.   details of plans and arrangements for reference and retention
                   samples;
           ix.     storage and transport conditions; and
           x.      details of the supply chain including manufacturing, packaging,
                   labelling and testing sites for the investigational medicinal products,
                   preferably in the format of a comprehensive diagram.

      4. This list of documents is neither exhaustive nor exclusive.

      5. The contents of the product specification file will vary depending on the
         product and the stage of development.

      6. Where different manufacturing steps are carried out at different locations
         under the responsibility of different Authorised Persons, it is acceptable to
         maintain separate files limited to information of relevance to the activities at
         the respective locations. The manufacturing site should have access to the
         necessary documentation of the product specification file, including changes,
         to enable the relevant activities to be performed.


3.    PERSONNEL
      1. The guidance in Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the PIC/S GMP Guide should be taken
         into account, as appropriate, in relation to the manufacture of investigational
         medicinal products.

      2. All personnel involved with the manufacture, import, storage or handling of
         investigational medicinal products should be appropriately trained in the
         requirements specific to these types of product.

      3. Even where the number of staff involved in the manufacturing or import of
         investigational medicinal products is small, there should be, for each batch,
         separate people responsible for production and quality control.

      4. The Authorised Person who certifies the finished batch of investigational

PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -184-                          25 August 2023
                         Annex 13    Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



         medicinal products for use in the clinical trial should ensure that there are
         systems in place that meet the requirements of good manufacturing practice
         and should have a broad knowledge of pharmaceutical development, clinical
         trial processes and supply chain of the batch concerned.


4.    PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT
      1. The toxicity, potency or sensitising potential may not be fully understood for
         investigational medicinal products and this reinforces the need to minimise all
         risks of cross-contamination. The design of equipment and premises,
         inspection/test methods and acceptance limits to be used after cleaning
         should reflect the nature of these risks and take account of the quality risk
         management principles detailed in Chapters 3 and 5 of Part 1 of the PIC/S
         GMP Guide.

      2. Consideration should be given to campaign manufacturing, where
         appropriate. Account should be taken of the solubility of the product in
         decisions about the choice of cleaning solvent.

      3. A quality risk management process, which includes a potency and
         toxicological evaluation, should be used to assess and control the cross-
         contamination risks presented by the investigational medicinal products
         manufactured. Factors that should be taken into account include:

           i.     facility/equipment design and use;
           ii.    personnel and material flow;
           iii.   microbiological controls;
           iv.    physio-chemical characteristics of the active substance;
           v.     process characteristics;
           vi.    cleaning processes;
           vii.   analytical capabilities relative to the relevant limits established from
                  the evaluation of the investigational medicinal products.

      4. Premises and equipment are expected to be qualified in accordance with
         Annex 15 to the PIC/S GMP Guide.


5.    DOCUMENTATION
      1. Documentation should be generated and controlled in line with the principles
         detailed in the PIC/S GMP Guide, Part I, Chapter 4. The retention period for
         instructions and records required to demonstrate compliance with good
         manufacturing practice should be defined according to the type of document
         while complying with any relevant national laws. The documentation shall be
         consistent with the Product Specification File. Documents which are part of
         the Product Specification File shall be retained for the period of at least 5
         years, unless otherwise specified in relevant national laws.

      2. The sponsor may have specific responsibilities for document retention of the
         clinical trial master file according to relevant national laws but unless


PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -185-                           25 August 2023
                         Annex 13     Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



         otherwise specified in national laws, should retain such documentation for at
         least 25 years after the end of the trial. If the sponsor and the manufacturer
         are not the same entity, the sponsor has to make appropriate arrangements
         with the manufacturer to fulfil the sponsor’s requirement to retain the clinical
         trial master file. Arrangement for retention of such documents and the type of
         documents to be retained should be defined in an agreement between the
         sponsor and manufacturer.

5.1   Specification and instructions
      1. Specifications for starting materials, immediate packaging materials,
         intermediate products, bulk products and finished products, manufacturing
         formulae and processing and packing instructions should be as
         comprehensive as possible given the current state of knowledge. They should
         be re-assessed during development and updated as necessary. Each new
         version should take into account the latest data, current technology used,
         regulatory and pharmacopoeial developments and should allow traceability
         to the previous document. Any changes should be carried out according to a
         written procedure which should address any implications for product quality
         such as stability and bioequivalence. The approval process for instructions
         and changes thereof shall include responsible personnel at the manufacturing
         site.

      2. Rationales for changes should be recorded and the consequences of a
         change on product quality and on any on-going clinical trials should be
         investigated and fully documented.

5.2   Order
      The manufacturer should retain the order for the investigational medicinal product
      as part of the batch documentation. The order should request the processing
      and/or packaging of a certain number of units and/or their distribution and be
      given by or on behalf of the sponsor to the manufacturer. The order should be in
      writing, though it may be transmitted by electronic means, and be precise enough
      to avoid any ambiguity. It should be formally authorised by the sponsor or his
      representative and refer to the product specification file and the relevant clinical
      trial protocol as appropriate.

5.3   Manufacturing formulae and processing instructions
      1. For every manufacturing operation or supply there should be clear and
         adequate written instructions and written records which are prepared using
         the specific clinical study information detailed in the product specification file.
         Records are particularly important for the preparation of the final version of
         the documents to be used in routine manufacture once the marketing
         authorisation is granted.

      2. The relevant information in the product specification file should be used to
         draft the detailed written instructions on processing, packaging, quality control
         testing, and storage, including storage conditions.




PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -186-                            25 August 2023
                         Annex 13     Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



5.4   Packaging instructions
      1. Investigational medicinal products are normally packed in an individual way
         for each subject included in the clinical trial. The number of units to be
         packaged should be specified prior to the start of the packaging operations,
         including units necessary for carrying out quality control and for any retention
         samples to be kept. Sufficient reconciliations should take place to ensure that
         the correct quantity of each product required has been accounted for at each
         stage of processing.

      2. Procedures should describe the specification, generation, testing, security,
         distribution, handling and retention of any randomisation code used for
         packaging investigational medicinal products as well as code-break
         mechanism. Appropriate records should be maintained.

5.5   Batch records
      1. Batch records should be kept in sufficient detail for the sequence of
         operations to be accurately determined. These records should contain any
         relevant remarks which justify procedures used and any changes made,
         enhance knowledge of the product, develop the manufacturing operations
         and document deviations from predefined requirements.

      2. Batch manufacturing records should be retained by the manufacturer for at
         least 5 years after the completion or formal discontinuation of the last clinical
         trial in which the batch was used, or in accordance with the requirements of
         national laws.


6.    PRODUCTION

6.1. Packaging materials
      Specifications and quality control checks should include measures to guard
      against unintentional unblinding due to changes in appearance between different
      batches of packaging materials.

6.2. Manufacturing operations
      1. During development critical parameters should be identified and in-process
         controls primarily used to control the process. Provisional production
         parameters and in-process controls may be deduced from prior experience,
         including that gained from earlier development work. Careful consideration by
         key personnel is called for in order to formulate the necessary instructions
         and to adapt them continually to the experience gained in production.
         Parameters identified and controlled should be justifiable based on
         knowledge available at the time.

      2. The manufacturing process is not required to be validated to the extent
         necessary for routine production but shall be validated in its entirety, as far
         as is appropriate, taking into account the stage of product development. The
         validation should be documented in accordance with the requirements


PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -187-                           25 August 2023
                        Annex 13     Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



         detailed in Annex 15 of the PIC/S GMP Guide. The manufacturer shall identify
         the process steps that safeguard the safety of the subject and the reliability
         and robustness of the clinical trial data generated in the clinical study.

      3. To avoid cross-contamination, written cleaning procedures and analytical
         methods to verify the cleaning process should be available.

      4. For sterile products, the validation of controls and processes related to
         assurance of sterility should be of the same standards as for authorised
         medicinal products and take account of the principles for the manufacture of
         sterile medicinal products as detailed in Annex 1 to the PIC/S GMP Guide.
         Likewise, when required, virus inactivation/removal and removal of other
         impurities of biological origin should be demonstrated, to assure the safety of
         biotechnologically derived and biological products by following the scientific
         principles and techniques defined in the available guidance in this area.

      5. Validation of aseptic processes presents special problems where the batch
         size is small; in these cases, the number of units filled may be the maximum
         number filled in production. If practicable, and otherwise consistent with
         simulating the process, a larger number of units should be filled with media
         to provide greater confidence in the results obtained. Filling and sealing is
         often a manual or semi-automated operation presenting great challenges to
         sterility, so enhanced attention should be given to operator training and
         validating the aseptic technique of individual operators.

6.3. Modification of comparator products
      1. If a product is modified, data should be available (e.g. stability, comparative
         dissolution or bioavailability) to demonstrate that these changes do not
         significantly alter the original quality characteristics of the product.

      2. The expiry date stated for the comparator product in its original packaging
         might not be applicable to the product where it has been repackaged in a
         different container that may not offer equivalent protection, or be compatible
         with the product. A suitable retest date, taking into account the nature of the
         product, the characteristics of the container and the storage conditions to
         which the product may be subjected, should be determined by or on behalf of
         the sponsor. Such a date should be justified and must not be later than the
         expiry date of the original package. There should be compatibility of expiry
         dating and clinical trial duration.

      3. A reference sample of comparator product, which has been repackaged or
         over encapsulated for blinding purposes, should be taken at a point
         representative of the additional processing and retained, as the additional
         processing step could have an impact on stability or be needed for
         identification purposes in the event of a quality defect investigation, which
         would not be covered by the commercial retained sample.

6.4   Blinding operations
      1. Where products are blinded, systems should be in place to ensure that the
         blind is achieved and maintained while allowing for identification of "blinded"


PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -188-                           25 August 2023
                         Annex 13     Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



         products, when necessary, including batch numbers of the products before
         the blinding operation. Rapid identification of product should also be possible
         in an emergency. Where the manufacturer has been delegated the
         responsibility for generation of randomisation codes, the manufacturer should
         enable that unblinding information is available to the appropriate responsible
         investigator site personnel before investigational medicinal products are
         supplied.

      2. Where products are blinded, the expiry date assigned to all products should
         be stated at the expiry of the shortest dated product so that the blinding is
         maintained.

6.5   Packaging
      1. During packaging of investigational medicinal products, it may be necessary
         to handle different products on the same packaging line at the same time.
         The risk of product unintentional mixing (mix-ups) must be minimised by using
         appropriate procedures and/or specialised equipment as appropriate and
         relevant staff training. Documentation must be sufficient to demonstrate that
         appropriate segregation has been maintained during any packaging
         operations.

      2. Packaging and labelling of investigational medicinal products are likely to be
         more complex and more liable to errors which are also harder to detect than
         for authorised medicinal products, particularly when blinded products with
         similar appearance are used. Precautions against mislabelling such as
         reconciliation, line clearance, in- process control checks by appropriately
         trained staff should accordingly be intensified.

      3. The packaging must ensure that the investigational medicinal product
         remains in good condition during transport and storage at intermediate
         destinations. Any opening or tampering of the outer packaging during
         transport should be readily discernible.

      4. Re-packaging operations may be performed by authorised personnel at a
         hospital, health centre or clinic that meet the requirements of relevant national
         laws or requirements (i.e. in healthcare establishments that are not otherwise
         subject to good manufacturing practices).

6.6   Labelling
      1. The labelling of investigational medicinal products shall comply with the
         requirements of relevant national laws or requirements, and where no such
         requirements exist, it should address at least the following elements, unless
         their absence can be justified, e.g. use of a centralised electronic
         randomisation system:

            i.    name, address and telephone number of the sponsor, contract
                  research organisation or investigator (the main contact for information
                  on the product, clinical trial and emergency unblinding);
            ii.   the name/identifier and strength/potency, and in the case of blinded
                  trials, all product labelling should indicate “placebo/comparator or


PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -189-                           25 August 2023
                           Annex 13    Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



                    [name/identifier] + [strength/potency]”
            iii.    pharmaceutical dosage form, route of administration, and quantity of
                    dosage units;
            iv.     the batch and/or code number to identify the contents and packaging
                    operation;
            v.      a trial reference code allowing identification of the trial, site,
                    investigator and sponsor if not given elsewhere;
            vi.     the trial subject identification number/treatment number and where
                    relevant, the visit number;
            vii.    the name of the investigator (if not included in (i) or (v));
            viii.   directions for use (reference may be made to a leaflet or other
                    explanatory document intended for the trial subject or person
                    administering the product);
            ix.     “For clinical trial use only” or similar wording;
            x.      the storage conditions;
            xi.     period of use (use-by date, expiry date or re-test date as applicable),
                    in month/year format and in a manner that avoids any ambiguity; and
            xii.    “keep out of reach of children” except when the product is for use in
                    trials where the product is not taken home by subjects.

      2. The information which shall appear on the labelling should comply with any
         relevant national laws or requirements. The labelling operation should be
         performed at an authorised manufacturing site in accordance with relevant
         national laws or requirements.

      3. If it becomes necessary to change the expiry date, an additional label should
         be affixed to the investigational medicinal product. This additional label
         should state the new expiry date and repeat the batch number and clinical
         trial reference number. It may be superimposed on the old expiry date, but for
         quality control reasons, not on the original batch number.

      4. The re-labelling operation should be performed by appropriately trained staff
         in accordance with good manufacturing practice principles and specific
         standard operating procedures and should be checked by a second person.
         This additional labelling should be properly documented in the batch records.
         To avoid mistakes the additional labelling activity should be carried out in an
         area which is partitioned or separated from other activities. A line clearance
         at the start and end of activity should be carried out and label reconciliation
         performed. Any discrepancies observed during reconciliation should be
         investigated and accounted for before release.

      5. The re-labelling operation may be performed by authorised personnel at a
         hospital, health centre or clinic that meet the requirements of relevant national
         laws or requirements (i.e. in healthcare establishments that are not subject to
         good manufacturing practices).




PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -190-                          25 August 2023
                         Annex 13     Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



7.    QUALITY CONTROL
      1. The manufacturer should establish and maintain a quality control system
         placed under the authority of a person who has the requisite qualifications
         and is independent of production.

      2. As processes may not be standardised or fully validated, testing takes on
         more importance in ensuring that each batch meets the approved
         specification at the time of testing.

      3. Quality control of the investigational medicinal product, including that of the
         comparator product, should be performed in accordance with the information
         submitted in the application for the clinical trial, as authorised by the relevant
         country.

      4. Verification of the effectiveness of blinding should be performed and
         recorded.

      5. Retention periods for samples of investigational medicinal products should
         comply with the relevant national laws or other requirements.

      6. Samples are retained to fulfil two purposes: firstly, to provide a sample for
         future analytical testing, and secondly, to provide a specimen of the finished
         investigational medicinal product which may be used in the investigation of a
         product quality defect.

      7. Samples may therefore fall into two categories:

            Reference sample: a sample of a batch of starting material, packaging
             material or finished product which is stored for the purpose of being
             analysed should the need arise. Where stability permits, reference
             samples from critical intermediate stages, e.g. those requiring analytical
             testing and release, or intermediates which are transported outside of the
             manufacturer's control, should be kept.

            Retention sample: a sample of a fully packaged unit from a batch of
             finished product. It is stored for identification purposes. For example,
             presentation, packaging, labelling, package leaflet, batch number, expiry
             date should the need arise during the shelf life of the batch concerned.

      8. There may be exceptional circumstances where this requirement can be met
         without retention of duplicate samples, e.g. where small amounts of a batch
         are packaged for different markets or in the production of very expensive
         medicinal products.

      9. For retention samples it is acceptable to store information related to the final
         packaging as written, photographic or electronic records, if such records
         provide sufficient information, e.g. examples of packaging, labelling and any
         accompanying documentation to permit investigations associated with the
         use of the product. In case of electronic records, the system should comply
         with the requirements of Annex 11 of the PIC/S GMP Guide.




PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -191-                           25 August 2023
                         Annex 13     Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



      10. Where reference samples and retention samples are presented identically,
          i.e. as fully packaged units, the samples may be regarded as interchangeable.

      11. Samples are not expected of an investigational medicinal product which is an
          unblinded comparator in its original packaging and sourced from the
          authorised supply chain in the country in which the clinical trial is intended to
          occur or of a product which holds a marketing authorisation granted by the
          national competent authority of the country in which the clinical trial occurs.
          (Note: In the EU, it might be the European Commission that has granted the
          marketing authorisation.)

      12. The storage location of samples should be defined in a technical agreement
          between the sponsor and the manufacturer(s) and should allow timely access
          by the competent authorities.

      13. Reference samples of finished product should be stored under defined
          storage conditions in the country in which the manufacturer is located or in
          another country where appropriate arrangements have been made between
          (or on behalf of) the two countries to ensure that the manufacturer of the
          investigational medicinal product applies standards of good manufacturing
          practice at least equivalent to those laid down by the PIC/S GMP Guide. In
          exceptional circumstances, the reference samples of the finished product
          may be stored by the manufacturer in another country, in which case this
          should be justified and documented in a technical agreement between the
          sponsor, the manufacturer and the storage site.

      14. The reference sample should be of sufficient size to perform, on at least two
          occasions, all critical quality attribute tests as defined in the investigational
          medicinal product dossier authorised by the relevant country. Any exception
          to this should be justified to, and agreed with, the national competent
          authority.


8.    RELEASE OF BATCHES
      1. Release of investigational medicinal products should not occur until after the
         Authorised Person has certified that the relevant requirements have been
         met. The Authorised Person should take into account the elements listed
         below, as appropriate.

      2. The scope of the certification can be limited to assuring that the products are
         in accordance with the authorisation of the clinical trial and any subsequent
         processing carried out by the manufacturer for the purpose of blinding, trial-
         specific packaging and labelling.

      3. The information in the product specification file should form the basis for
         assessment of the suitability for certification and release of a particular batch
         by the Authorised Person and should therefore be accessible to him or her.

      4. Assessment by the Authorised Person of each batch for certification prior to
         release should take account of the principles detailed in Annex 16 of the
         PIC/S GMP Guide and may include as appropriate;



PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -192-                           25 August 2023
                          Annex 13     Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



           i.      batch records, including control reports, in-process test reports and
                   release reports demonstrating compliance with the product
                   specification file, the order, protocol and randomisation code. These
                   records should include all deviations or planned changes, and any
                   consequent additional checks and tests, and should be completed
                   and endorsed by the staff authorised to do so according to the quality
                   system;
           ii.     production conditions;
           iii.    cleaning records;
           iv.     the qualification status of facilities, validation status of processes and
                   methods;
           v.      examination of finished packs;
           vi.     the results of any analyses or tests performed after importation,
                   where relevant;
           vii.    stability plan and reports;
           viii.   the source and verification of conditions of storage and shipment;
           ix.     audit reports concerning the quality system of the manufacturer;
           x.      documents certifying that the manufacturer is authorised to
                   manufacture investigational medicinal product for export (as
                   applicable under national law); by the appropriate authorities in the
                   relevant country;
           xi.     where relevant, regulatory requirements for marketing authorisation,
                   good manufacturing practice standards applicable and any official
                   verification of compliance with good manufacturing practice;
           xii.    verification of the supply chain including manufacturing, packaging,
                   labelling and testing sites for the investigational medicinal products;
                   and
           xiii.   all factors of which the Authorised Person is aware that are relevant
                   to the quality of the batch.

      5. The relevance of the above elements is affected by the country of origin of
         the product, the manufacturer, the status of the product, i.e. with or without a
         marketing authorisation granted by the relevant competent authority, and the
         phase of development of the product.

      6. Where investigational medicinal products are produced and packaged at
         different sites under the supervision of different Authorised Persons, sharing
         of responsibilities amongst the Authorised Persons in relation to compliance
         of a batch must be defined in a document formally agreed by all parties.

      7. Where required to support certification, the Authorised Person has to ensure
         that the investigational medicinal product has been stored and transported
         under conditions that maintain product quality and supply chain security.
         Relevant situations may include short expiry date products released prior to
         final Authorised Person certification, or where return of investigational
         medicinal products to an authorised manufacturer for re-labelling and re-
         packaging remains a possibility.

      8. Where the manufacturer is delegated by the sponsor to perform the regulatory
         release in addition to certification by the Authorised Person, the


PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -193-                            25 August 2023
                         Annex 13    Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



         arrangements should be defined in an agreement between the sponsor and
         the manufacturer. Relevant clinical trial authorisation and amendment
         information should be available for reference in the product specification file
         and the manufacturer should ensure the necessary clinical trial authorisations
         are in place and prior to shipping product for use in the trial.

      9. After certification by the Authorised Person, the investigational medicinal
         product should be stored and transported under conditions that maintain
         product quality and supply chain security.

      10. The Authorised Person is not required to certify re-packaging (section 6.5) or
          re-labelling (section 6.6) performed by authorised personnel at a hospital,
          health centre or clinic that meet the requirements of relevant national laws or
          requirements.


9.    OUTSOURCED OPERATIONS
      Activities which are outsourced should be defined, agreed and controlled by
      written contracts between the contract giver and the party to whom the operations
      are outsourced in accordance with the principles detailed in Part I, Chapter 7 of
      the PIC/S GMP Guide.


10.   COMPLAINTS
      1. There should be written procedures describing the actions to be taken upon
         receipt of a complaint at the manufacturing, storage or importation site. All
         complaints should be documented and assessed to establish if they represent
         a potential quality defect or other issue. The procedures should ensure that
         the sponsor is able to assess the complaints to determine if they justify the
         reporting of a serious breach to the relevant competent authority.

      2. The investigation of quality defect should be performed in accordance with
         the principles detailed in Part I, Chapter 8 of the PIC/S GMP Guide.

      3. The conclusions of the investigation should be discussed between the
         manufacturer and the sponsor, if different, in a timely manner. This should
         involve the Authorised Person and those responsible for the relevant clinical
         trial in order to asses any potential impact on the trial, product development
         and on subjects.


11.   RECALLS AND RETURNS

11.1 Recalls
      1. Procedures for retrieving investigational medicinal products and documenting
         such retrievals should be in line with relevant national laws and guidelines,
         and be agreed by the sponsor in cooperation with the manufacturer, where
         different. The manufacturer, investigator and the sponsor's representative
         need to understand their obligations under the retrieval procedure. The


PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -194-                          25 August 2023
                           Annex 13    Manufacture of investigational medicinal products



           procedures for retrieval of investigational medicinal products should be in
           accordance with the principles detailed in Chapter 8 of the PIC/S GMP Guide.

       2. To facilitate recall, a detailed inventory of the shipments made by the
          manufacturer should be maintained.

11.2 Returns
       Returned investigational medicinal products should be clearly identified and
       stored in an appropriately controlled, dedicated area. Inventory records of
       returned products should be kept.

11.3 Destruction
       1. The manufacturer or sponsor’s representative should destroy investigational
          medicinal products only with prior written authorisation by the sponsor. The
          arrangements for destruction of investigational medicinal products have to be
          described in the protocol. Any arrangement between sponsor and
          manufacturer in this regard should be defined in their technical agreement.

       2. Destruction of unused investigational medicinal products should be carried
          out only after reconciliation of delivered, used and recovered products and
          after investigation and satisfactory explanation of any discrepancies upon
          which the reconciliation has been accepted.

       3. Records of destruction operations should be retained, including a dated
          certificate of destruction or a receipt for destruction to the sponsor. These
          documents should clearly identify or allow traceability to the batches and/or
          patient numbers involved and the actual quantities destroyed.


GLOSSARY TO ANNEX 13
Blinding
A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are kept unaware of the treatment
assignment(s). Single-blinding usually refers to the subject(s) being unaware, and
double-blinding usually refers to the subject(s), investigator(s), monitor, and, in some
cases, data analyst(s) being unaware of the treatment assignment(s). In relation to an
investigational medicinal product, blinding shall mean the deliberate disguising of the
identity of the product in accordance with the instructions of the sponsor. Unblinding shall
mean the disclosure of the identity of blinded products.

Good Practice guidelines
Good practice guidelines give interpretation on the national standards and specifications
defined for quality systems in blood establishments5.

Medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma
Medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma6 are medicinal products
based on blood constituents which are prepared industrially by public or private
establishments.

Plasma for fractionation
Plasma for fractionation is the liquid part of human blood remaining after separation of
the cellular elements from blood collected in a container containing an anticoagulant, or
separated by continuous filtration or centrifugation of anti-coagulated blood in an
apheresis procedure; it is intended for the manufacture of plasma derived medicinal
products, in particular albumin, coagulation factors and immunoglobulins of human origin
and specified in the European (or other relevant) Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) monograph
“Human Plasma for fractionation” (0853).

Plasma Master File (PMF)
A Plasma Master File7 is a stand-alone document, which is separate from the dossier for
marketing authorisation. It provides all relevant detailed information on the
characteristics of the entire human plasma used as a starting material and/or a raw
material for the manufacture of sub/intermediate fractions, constituents of the excipients
and active substances, which are part of plasma, derived medicinal products or medical
devices.

Processing
Processing8 means any step in the preparation of blood component that is carried out
between the collection of blood and the issuing of a blood component, e.g. separation
and freezing of blood components. In this Annex, processing in addition refers to those
operations performed at the blood establishment that are specific to plasma to be used
for fractionation.

Responsible Person (RP)
A person responsible for securing that each batch of (biological) active substance or
medicinal product has been manufactured and checked in compliance with the laws in
force and in accordance with the specifications and/or requirements of the marketing
authorisation. The RP is equivalent to the EU term “Qualified Person” 9.

Responsible Person (RP) for blood establishment
A person responsible for ensuring that every unit of blood or blood components has been
collected and tested, processed, stored and distributed in compliance with the laws in
force. This term is equivalent to the EU term “Responsible Person”10.

                Annex 14     Manufacture of products derived from human blood or plasma



Contract fractionation program
This is a contract fractionation in a national plant of a fractionator/manufacturer, using
starting material from other countries and manufacturing products not intended for the
national market.


1.       SCOPE
1.1      The provisions of this Annex apply to medicinal products derived from human
         blood or plasma, fractionated in or imported into the country. The Annex applies
         also to the starting material (e.g. human plasma) for these products. In line with
         national legislation11 the requirements may apply also for stable derivatives of
         human blood or human plasma (e.g. Albumin) incorporated into medical devices.

1.2      This Annex defines specific Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements
         for collection, processing, storage and transport of human plasma used for
         fractionation and for the manufacture of medicinal products derived from human
         blood or plasma.

1.3      The Annex addresses specific provisions for when starting material is imported
         from other countries and for contract fractionation programs for other countries.

1.4      The Annex does not apply to blood components intended for transfusion.


2.       PRINCIPLES
2.1      Medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma (and their active
         substances which are used as starting materials) must comply with the principles
         and guidelines of Good Manufacturing Practice12 as well as the relevant
         marketing authorisation. They are considered to be biological medicinal products
         and the starting materials include biological substances, such as cells or fluids
         (including blood or plasma) of human origin. Certain special features arise from
         the biological nature of the source material. For example, disease- transmitting
         agents, especially viruses, may contaminate the source material. The quality and
         safety of these products relies therefore on the control of source materials and
         their origin as well as on the subsequent manufacturing procedures, including
         infectious marker testing, virus removal and virus inactivation.

2.2      In principle active substances used as starting material for medicinal products
         must comply with the principles and guidelines of Good Manufacturing Practice
         (see 2.1). For starting materials derived from human blood and plasma national13
         or international requirements for blood establishments involved in the collection,
         preparation and testing are to be followed. Collection, preparation and testing




11   For EU/EEA as set out in Directive 2003/63/EC
12   For EU/EEA this is laid down in Commission Directive 2003/94/EC and the EU Guidelines on GMP
     published by the European Commission.
13   For EU/EEA requirement for the collection and testing are defined in Directive 2002/98/EC.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -200-                             25 August 2023
                  Annex 14       Manufacture of products derived from human blood or plasma



          must be performed in accordance with an appropriate quality system14 and for
          which standards and specifications are defined. Furthermore, the national15 or
          international requirements on traceability and serious adverse reactions and
          serious adverse event notifications from the donor to the recipient should be
          applied. Reference is hereby made to international guidelines as defined in the
          addendum. In addition the monographs of the relevant Pharmacopoeia16 are to
          be observed.

2.3       Starting material for the manufacture of medicinal products derived from human
          blood or plasma imported from other countries and intended for use or distribution
          within the country must meet the national17 standards.

2.4       In the case of contract fractionation programs the starting material imported from
          other countries must comply with the national or equivalent18 quality and safety
          requirements for blood components. The activities conducted within the country
          must fully comply with GMP. Consideration should be given to national19
          standards and specifications relating to a quality system for blood
          establishments, the traceability requirements and notification of serious adverse
          reactions and events and the relevant WHO guidelines and recommendations as
          listed in the addendum.

2.5       All subsequent steps after collection and testing (e.g. processing (including
          separation), freezing, storage and transport to the manufacturer) must therefore
          be done in accordance with the principles and guidelines of Good Manufacturing
          Practice20. Normally, these activities would be carried out under the responsibility
          of a Responsible Person in an establishment with a manufacturing authorisation.
          Where specific processing steps in relation to plasma for fractionation take place
          in a blood establishment, the specific appointment of a Responsible Person may,
          however, not be proportionate given the presence and responsibility of a
          Responsible Person of the blood establishment. To address this particular
          situation and to ensure the legal responsibilities of the Responsible Person are
          properly addressed, the fractionation plant/manufacturer should establish a
          contract in accordance with Chapter 7 of the GMP Guide with the blood
          establishment that defines respective responsibilities and the detailed


14   For EU/EEA standards and specifications for quality systems are defined in the Annex of Directive
     2005/62/EC and interpreted in the Good Practice guidelines referred to in Article 2 (2) of Directive
     2005/62/EC.
15   For EU/EEA requirements on traceability and serious adverse reactions and serious adverse event
     notifications are defined in Directive 2005/61/EC.
16   For EU/EEA this is the European Pharmacopoeia as defined in Directive 2002/98/EC.
17   For EU/EEA these standards are equivalent to Community Standards and specifications relating to a
     quality system for blood establishments as set out in Commission Directive 2005/62/EC (Recital 6; Article
     2(3)), the traceability and serious adverse reaction and serious adverse event notification requirements
     as set out in Commission Directive 2005/61/EC (Recital 5; Article 7), and the technical requirements for
     blood and blood components as set out in Commission Directive 2004/33/EC (Recital 4; point 2.3 of
     Annex V).
18   For EU/EEA reference is made to the quality and safety requirements as laid down in Directive
     2002/98/EC and in Annex V of Directive 2004/33/EC.
19   For EU/EEA considerations should be given to the Community standards and specifications relating to
     a quality system for blood establishments set out in Commission Directive 2005/62/EC and the
     traceability requirements and notification of serious adverse reactions and events as set out in
     Commission Directive 2005/61/EC.
20   For EU/EEA the requirements of Directive 2001/83/EC apply.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                                -201-                                 25 August 2023
                 Annex 14      Manufacture of products derived from human blood or plasma



          requirements in order to ensure compliance. The Responsible Person of the
          blood      establishment    and     the     Responsible     Person      of    the
          fractionation/manufacturing plant (see 3.5) should be involved in drawing up this
          contract. The Responsible Person should ensure that audits are performed to
          confirm that the blood establishment complies with the contract.

2.6       Depending on national legislation, specific requirements for documentation and
          other arrangements relating to the starting material of plasma-derived medicinal
          products are defined in the Plasma Master File.


3.        QUALITY MANAGEMENT
3.1       Quality management should govern all stages from donor selection in the blood
          establishment up to delivery of the finished product by the finished product
          manufacturer. Traceability of each donation up to and including the delivery of
          plasma to the fractionation plant should be ensured by the blood establishment
          through accurate identification procedures, record maintenance and an
          appropriate labelling system according to national21 or international
          requirements, and should be maintained during further manufacturing and
          distribution of final products by the manufacturer.

3.2       Blood or plasma used as source material for the manufacture of medicinal
          products must be collected and processed by blood establishments and be tested
          in laboratories which apply quality systems in accordance with national22 or
          international standards. Reference is made to documents listed in the addendum.
          The blood establishments have to be authorised and subject to regular
          inspections by a national competent authority23. Contract fractionation programs
          have to be notified to the competent authority by the manufacturer24.

3.3       If plasma is imported from other countries it should only be purchased from
          approved suppliers (e.g. blood establishments, including external warehouses).
          They should be named in the specifications for starting materials as defined by
          the fractionation plant/manufacturer, and be accepted by the competent authority
          (e.g. following an inspection) of the importing country and by the Responsible
          Person of the importing fractionation plant. Certification and release of plasma
          (plasma for fractionation) as starting material is mentioned in section 6.8.

3.4       Supplier qualification, including audits, should be performed by the fractionation
          plant/manufacturer of the finished product including test laboratory according to
          written procedures. Re-qualification of suppliers should be performed at regular
          intervals taking a risk-based approach into account.

3.5       The fractionation plant/manufacturer of the finished product should establish
          written contracts with the supplying blood establishments. As a minimum the
          following key aspects should be addressed:
          -    definition of duties and respective responsibilities

21   For EU/EEA reference is made to Directive 2005/61/EC and to Directive 2005/62/EC.
22   For EU/EEA reference is made to Directive 2005/62/EC.
23   For EU/EEA as referred to in Directive 2002/98/EC
24   For EU/EEA it is the competent authority as referred to in Directive 2001/83/EC.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                             -202-                               25 August 2023
                 Annex 14       Manufacture of products derived from human blood or plasma



          -    quality system and documentation requirements
          -    donor selection criteria and testing
          -    requirements for the separation of blood into blood components/plasma
          -    freezing of plasma
          -    storage and transport of plasma
          -    traceability and post donation / collection information (including adverse
               events).

          The test results of all units supplied by the blood establishment should be
          available to the fractionation plant/manufacturer of the medicinal product. In
          addition, any fractionation step subcontracted should be defined in a written
          contract.

3.6       A formal change control system should be in place to plan, evaluate and
          document all changes that may affect the quality or safety of the products, or
          traceability. The potential impact of proposed changes should be evaluated. The
          need for additional testing and validation, especially viral inactivation and removal
          steps, should be determined.

3.7       An adequate safety strategy should be in place to minimise the risk from
          infectious agents and emerging infectious agents. This strategy should involve a
          risk assessment that:
          -    defines an inventory holding time (internal quarantine time) before
               processing the plasma i.e. to remove look back units25.
          -    considers all aspects of virus reduction and/or testing for infectious agents
               or surrogates.
          -    considers the virus reduction capabilities, the pool size and other relevant
               aspects of the manufacturing processes.


4.        TRACEABILITY AND POST COLLECTION MEASURES
4.1       There must be a system in place that enables each donation to be traced, from
          the donor and the donation via the blood establishment through to the batch of
          medicinal product and vice versa.

4.2       Responsibilities for traceability of the product should be defined (there should be
          no gaps):
          -   from the donor and the donation in the blood establishment to the
              fractionation plant (this is the responsibility of the RP of the blood
              establishment);
          -   from the fractionation plant to the manufacturer of the medicinal product and
              any secondary facility, whether a manufacturer of a medicinal product or of
              a medical device (this is the responsibility of the RP).




25   Plasma units donated by donors during a defined period (as defined on a national / EU basis) before it
     is found that a donation from a high-risk donor should have been excluded from processing, e.g. due to
     a positive test result.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                               -203-                                25 August 2023
                  Annex 14       Manufacture of products derived from human blood or plasma



4.3       Data needed for full traceability must be stored according to national legislation 26.

4.4       The contracts (as mentioned in 3.5) between the blood establishments (including
          testing laboratories) and the fractionation plant/manufacturer should ensure that
          traceability and post collection measures cover the complete chain from the
          collection of the plasma to all manufacturers responsible for release of the final
          products.

4.5       The blood establishments should notify the fractionating plant/manufacturer of
          any event which may affect the quality or safety of the product including serious
          adverse events and reactions27 and other relevant information found subsequent
          to donor acceptance or release of the plasma, e.g. look back information28 (post-
          collection information). Where the fractionation plant/manufacturer is located in
          another country, the information should be forwarded to the manufacturer
          responsible for release in the country of any product manufactured from the
          plasma concerned. In both cases, if relevant for the quality or safety of the final
          product, this information should be forwarded to the competent authority29
          responsible for the fractionation plant/manufacturer as required by national
          legislation.

4.6       The notification procedure as described in 4.5 also applies when an inspection of
          a blood establishment by a competent authority leads to a withdrawal of an
          existing licence/certificate/ approval.

4.7       The management of post-collection information should be described in standard
          operating procedures and taking into account obligations and procedures for
          informing the competent authorities. Post-collection measures should be
          available as defined in national or relevant international recommendations30.
          The blood establishment and the fractionation/manufacturer should inform each
          other if, following donation:
          - It is found that the donor did not meet the relevant donor health criteria;
          - A subsequent donation from a donor previously found negative for viral
             markers is found positive for any of the viral markers;
          - It is discovered that testing for viral markers has not been carried out according
             to agreed procedures;
          - The donor has developed an infectious disease caused by an agent potentially
             transmissible by plasma-derived products (HBV, HCV, HAV and other non-A,
             non-B, non-C hepatitis viruses, HIV-1 and 2 and other agents in the light of
             current knowledge);

26   For EU/EEA this is for at least 30 years according to Article 4 of Directive 2005/61/EC and Article 14 of
     Directive 2002/98/EC. Both Directives are linked to Article 109 of Directive 2001/83/EC by defining
     specific rules for medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma.
27   For EU/EEA reference is made to in Annex II part A and Annex III part A of Directive 2005/61/EC.
28   Information that appears if a subsequent donation from a donor previously found negative for viral
     markers is found positive for any of the viral markers or any other risk factors which may induce a viral
     infection.
29   For EU/EEA this is the competent authority as referred to in Directive 2001/83/EC.
30   For EU/EEA referene is made to the “Note for Guidance on Plasma Derived Medicinal Products" in its
     current version as adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and
     published by the European Medicines Agency. Current version at date of publication:
     CPMP/BWP/269/95.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                                -204-                                 25 August 2023
                 Annex 14       Manufacture of products derived from human blood or plasma



          - The donor develops Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD or vCJD);
          - The recipient of blood or a blood component develops post-transfusion
            infection which implicates or can be traced back to the donor.
          In the event of any of the above, a re-assessment of the batch documentation
          should always be carried out. The need for withdrawal of the given batch should
          be carefully considered, taking into account criteria such as the transmissible
          agent involved, the size of the pool, the time period between donation and
          seroconversion, the nature of the product and its manufacturing method.


5.        PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT
5.1       In order to minimise microbiological contamination or the introduction of foreign
          material into the plasma pool, thawing and pooling of plasma units should be
          performed in an area conforming at least to the Grade D requirements defined in
          Annex 1 of the PIC/S GMP Guide. Appropriate clothing should be worn including
          face masks and gloves. All other open manipulations during the manufacturing
          process should be done under conditions conforming to the appropriate
          requirements of Annex 1 of the PIC/S GMP Guide.

5.2       Environmental monitoring should be performed regularly, especially during the
          ‘opening’ of plasma containers, and during subsequent thawing and pooling
          processes in accordance with Annex 1 of the PIC/S GMP Guide.

5.3       In the production of plasma-derived medicinal products, appropriate viral
          inactivation or removal procedures are used and steps should be taken to prevent
          cross contamination of treated with untreated products. Dedicated and distinct
          premises and equipment should be used for manufacturing steps before and after
          viral inactivation treatment.

5.4       To avoid placing routine manufacture at risk of contamination from viruses used
          during validation studies, the validation of methods for virus reduction should not
          be conducted in production facilities. Validation should be performed according
          to international recommendations31.


6.        MANUFACTURING
Starting material
6.1       The starting material should comply with the requirements of all relevant
          monographs of the relevant Pharmacopoeia and of the conditions laid down in
          the respective marketing authorisation dossier (including the Plasma Master File
          if applicable). These requirements should be defined in the written contract (see
          3.5) between the blood establishment and the fractionating plant/manufacturer
          and controlled through the quality system.


31   For EU/EEA reference is made to the "Note for Guidance on Virus Validation Studies: The Design,
     Contribution and Interpretation of Studies validating the Inactivation and Removal of Viruses" in its
     current version as adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and
     published by the European Medicines Agency. Current version at date of publication:

             Annex 14    Manufacture of products derived from human blood or plasma



6.2.   Starting material imported for contract fractionation programs should comply with
       the requirements as specified in 2.4.

6.3    Depending on the type of collection (i.e. either whole blood collection or
       automated apheresis) different processing steps may be required. All processing
       steps (e.g. centrifugation and/or separation, sampling, labelling, freezing) should
       be defined in written procedures.

6.4    Any mix-ups of units and of samples, especially during labelling, as well as any
       contamination, e.g. when cutting the tube segments/sealing the containers, must
       be avoided.

6.5    Freezing is a critical step for the recovery of proteins that are labile in plasma,
       e.g. clotting factors. Freezing should therefore be performed as soon as possible
       after collection (see the European Pharmacopoeia monograph No 0853 "Human
       Plasma for Fractionation" and where relevant, monograph No 1646 "Human
       Plasma pooled and treated for virus inactivation", or other relevant
       Pharmacopoeia), following a validated method.

6.6    The storage and transport of blood or plasma at any stage in the transport chain
       to the fractionation plant should be defined and recorded. Any deviation from the
       defined temperature should be notified to the fractionation plant. Qualified
       equipment and validated procedures should be used.

Certification/release of plasma for fractionation as starting material
6.7    Plasma for fractionation should only be released, i.e. from a quarantine status,
       through systems and procedures that assure the quality needed for the
       manufacture of the finished product. It should only be distributed to the plasma
       fractionation plant/manufacturer after it has been documented by the
       Responsible Person of the blood establishment (or in case of blood/plasma
       collection in other countries by a person with equivalent responsibilities and
       qualifications) that the plasma for fractionation does comply with the
       requirements and specifications defined in the respective written contracts and
       that all steps have been performed in accordance with Good Practice and GMP
       Guidelines, as appropriate.

6.8    On entering the fractionation plant, the plasma units should be released for
       fractionation under the responsibility of the Responsible Person. The
       Responsible Person should confirm that the plasma complies with the
       requirements of all relevant monographs and the conditions laid down in the
       respective marketing authorisation dossier (including the Plasma Master File if
       applicable) or, in case of plasma to be used for contract fractionation programs,
       with the requirements as specified in 2.4.

Processing of plasma for fractionation
6.9    The steps used in the fractionation process vary according to product and
       manufacturer and usually include several fractionation/purification procedures,
       some of which may contribute to the inactivation and/or removal of potential
       contamination.

                Annex 14      Manufacture of products derived from human blood or plasma



6.10     Requirements for the processes of pooling, pool sampling and
         fractionation/purification and virus inactivation/removal should be defined and
         followed thoroughly.

6.11     The methods used in the viral inactivation process should be undertaken with
         strict adherence to validated procedures and in compliance with the methods
         used in the virus validation studies. Detailed investigation of failures in virus
         inactivation procedures should be performed. Adherence to the validated
         production process is especially important in the virus reduction procedures as
         any deviation could result in a safety risk for the final product. Procedures which
         take this risk into consideration should be in place.

6.12     Any reprocessing or reworking may only be performed after a quality risk
         management exercise has been performed and using processing steps as
         defined in the relevant marketing authorisation.

6.13     A system for clearly segregating/distinguishing between products or
         intermediates which have undergone a process of virus reduction, from those
         which have not, should be in place.

6.14     Depending on the outcome of a thorough risk management process (taking into
         consideration possible differences in epidemiology) production in campaigns
         including clear segregation and defined validated cleaning procedures should be
         adopted when plasma/intermediates of different origins is processed at the same
         plant. The requirement for such measures should be based on international
         recommendations32. The risk management process should consider whether it is
         necessary to use dedicated equipment in the case of contract fractionation
         programs.

6.15     For intermediate products intended to be stored, a shelf-life should be defined
         based on stability data.

6.16     The storage and transport of intermediate and finished medicinal products at any
         stage of the transport chain should be specified and recorded. Qualified
         equipment and validated procedures should be used.


7.       QUALITY CONTROL
7.1      Testing requirements for viruses or other infectious agents should be considered
         in the light of knowledge emerging on infectious agents and on the availability of
         appropriate, validated test methods.

7.2      The first homogeneous plasma pool (e.g. after separation of the cryoprecipitate
         from the plasma pool) should be tested using validated test methods of suitable
         sensitivity and specificity, according to the relevant Pharmacopoeia
         monographs33.



32   For EU/EEA, see Guideline on Epidemiological Data on Blood Transmissible Infections,
     EMEA/CPMP/BWP/125/04.
33   For EU/EEA reference is made to the relevant European Pharmacopoeia monographs (e.g. No 0853).

             Annex 14     Manufacture of products derived from human blood or plasma



8.     RELEASE OF INTERMEDIATE AND FINISHED PRODUCTS
8.1    Only batches derived from plasma pools tested and found negative for virus
       markers / antibodies and found in compliance with the relevant Pharmacopoeia
       monographs, including any specific virus cut-off limits, and with the approved
       specifications (e.g. Plasma Master File if applicable), should be released.

8.2    The release of intermediates intended for further in-house processing or delivery
       to a different site and the release of finished products should be performed by the
       Responsible Person and in accordance with the approved marketing
       authorisation.

8.3.   The release of intermediates and final products used in contract fractionation
       programs should be performed by the Responsible Person on the basis of
       standards agreed with the contract giver and compliance with PIC/S GMP
       standards.


9.     RETENTION OF PLASMA POOL SAMPLES
       One plasma pool may be used to manufacture more than one batch and/or
       product. Retention samples and corresponding records from every pool should
       be kept for at least one year after the expiry date of the finished medicinal product
       with the longest shelf-life derived from the pool.


10.    DISPOSAL OF WASTE
       There should be written procedures for the safe and documented storage and
       disposal of waste, disposable and rejected items (e.g. contaminated units, units
       from infected donors, out of date blood, plasma, intermediate or finished
       products).

                                                   Annex 15    Qualification and validation



ANNEX 15

                QUALIFICATION AND VALIDATION


PRINCIPLE

       This Annex describes the principles of qualification and validation which are
       applicable to the facilities, equipment, utilities and processes used for the
       manufacture of medicinal products and may also be used as supplementary
       optional guidance for active substances without introduction of additional
       requirements to Part II. It is a GMP requirement that manufacturers control the
       critical aspects of their particular operations through qualification and validation
       over the life cycle of the product and process. Any planned changes to the
       facilities, equipment, utilities and processes, which may affect the quality of the
       product, should be formally documented and the impact on the validated status
       or control strategy assessed. Computerised systems used for the manufacture of
       medicinal products should also be validated according to the requirements of
       Annex 11. The relevant concepts and guidance presented in ICH Q8, Q9, Q10
       and Q11 should also be taken into account.

GENERAL
       A quality risk management approach should be applied throughout the lifecycle
       of a medicinal product. As part of a quality risk management system, decisions
       on the scope and extent of qualification and validation should be based on a
       justified and documented risk assessment of the facilities, equipment, utilities and
       processes. Retrospective validation is no longer considered an acceptable
       approach.

       Data supporting qualification and/or validation studies which were obtained from
       sources outside of the manufacturers own programmes may be used provided
       that this approach has been justified and that there is adequate assurance that
       controls were in place throughout the acquisition of such data.


1.     ORGANISING AND PLANNING FOR QUALIFICATION AND
       VALIDATION
1.1    All qualification and validation activities should be planned and take the life cycle
       of facilities, equipment, utilities, process and product into consideration.

1.2    Qualification and validation activities should only be performed by suitably trained
       personnel who follow approved procedures.

1.3    Qualification/validation personnel should report as defined in the pharmaceutical
       quality system although this may not necessarily be to a quality management or
       a quality assurance function. However, there should be appropriate quality
       oversight over the whole validation life cycle.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -212-                           25 August 2023
                                                       Annex 15   Qualification and validation




1.4          The key elements of the site qualification and validation programme should be
             clearly defined and documented in a validation master plan (VMP) or equivalent
             document.

1.5          The VMP or equivalent document should define the qualification/validation
             system and include or reference information on at least the following:

        i.     Qualification and Validation policy;
       ii.     The organisational structure including roles and responsibilities for
               qualification and validation activities;
      iii.     Summary of the facilities, equipment, systems, processes on site and the
               qualification and validation status;
      iv.      Change control and deviation management for qualification and validation ;
       v.      Guidance on developing acceptance criteria;
      vi.      References to existing documents;
      vii.     The qualification and validation strategy, including requalification, where
               applicable.

1.6          For large and complex projects, planning takes on added importance and
             separate validation plans may enhance clarity

1.7          A quality risk management approach should be used for qualification and
             validation activities. In light of increased knowledge and understanding from any
             changes during the project phase or during commercial production, the risk
             assessments should be repeated, as required. The way in which risk
             assessments are used to support qualification and validation activities should be
             clearly documented.

1.8          Appropriate checks should be incorporated into qualification and validation work
             to ensure the integrity of all data obtained.


2.           DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING VMP
2.1          Good documentation practices are important to support knowledge management
             throughout the product lifecycle.

2.2          All documents generated during qualification and validation should be approved
             and authorised by appropriate personnel as defined in the pharmaceutical quality
             system.

2.3          The inter-relationship between documents in complex validation projects should
             be clearly defined.

2.4          Validation protocols should be prepared which defines the critical systems,
             attributes and parameters and the associated acceptance criteria.

                                                   Annex 15    Qualification and validation



2.5    Qualification documents may be combined together, where appropriate, e.g.
       installation qualification (IQ) and operational qualification (OQ).

2.6    Where validation protocols and other documentation are supplied by a third party
       providing validation services, appropriate personnel at the manufacturing site
       should confirm suitability and compliance with internal procedures before
       approval. Vendor protocols may be supplemented by additional
       documentation/test protocols before use.

2.7    Any significant changes to the approved protocol during execution, e.g.
       acceptance criteria, operating parameters etc., should be documented as a
       deviation and be scientifically justified.

2.8    Results which fail to meet the pre-defined acceptance criteria should be recorded
       as a deviation, and be fully investigated according to local procedures. Any
       implications for the validation should be discussed in the report.

2.9    The review and conclusions of the validation should be reported and the results
       obtained summarised against the acceptance criteria. Any subsequent changes
       to acceptance criteria should be scientifically justified and a final recommendation
       made as to the outcome of the validation.

2.10   A formal release for the next stage in the qualification and validation process
       should be authorised by the relevant responsible personnel either as part of the
       validation report approval or as a separate summary document. Conditional
       approval to proceed to the next qualification stage can be given where certain
       acceptance criteria or deviations have not been fully addressed and there is a
       documented assessment that there is no significant impact on the next activity.


3.     QUALIFICATION STAGES FOR EQUIPMENT, FACILITIES,
       UTILITIES AND SYSTEMS.
3.1    Qualification activities should consider all stages from initial development of the
       user requirements specification through to the end of use of the equipment,
       facility, utility or system. The main stages and some suggested criteria (although
       this depends on individual project circumstances and may be different) which
       could be included in each stage are indicated below:

User requirements specification (URS)

3.2    The specification for equipment, facilities, utilities or systems should be defined
       in a URS and/or a functional specification. The essential elements of quality need
       to be built in at this stage and any GMP risks mitigated to an acceptable level.
       The URS should be a point of reference throughout the validation life cycle.

Design qualification (DQ)

3.3    The next element in the qualification of equipment, facilities, utilities, or systems
       is DQ where the compliance of the design with GMP should be demonstrated
       and documented. The requirements of the user requirements specification should
       be verified during the design qualification.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -214-                           25 August 2023
                                                           Annex 15     Qualification and validation




Factory acceptance testing (FAT) /Site acceptance testing (SAT)

3.4           Equipment, especially if incorporating novel or complex technology, may be
              evaluated, if applicable, at the vendor prior to delivery.

3.5           Prior to installation, equipment should be confirmed to comply with the URS/
              functional specification at the vendor site, if applicable.

3.6           Where appropriate and justified, documentation review and some tests could be
              performed at the FAT or other stages without the need to repeat on site at IQ/OQ
              if it can be shown that the functionality is not affected by the transport and
              installation.

3.7           FAT may be supplemented by the execution of a SAT following the receipt of
              equipment at the manufacturing site.

Installation qualification (IQ)

3.8           IQ should be performed on equipment, facilities, utilities, or systems.

3.9           IQ should include, but is not limited to the following:

        i.       Verification of the correct installation of components, instrumentation,
                 equipment, pipe work and services against the engineering drawings and
                 specifications;
       ii.       Verification of the correct installation against pre-defined criteria;
       iii.      Collection and collation of supplier operating and working instructions and
                 maintenance requirements;
       iv.       Calibration of instrumentation;
       v.        Verification of the materials of construction.

Operational qualification (OQ)

3.10          OQ normally follows IQ but depending on the complexity of the equipment, it may
              be performed as a combined Installation/Operation Qualification (IOQ).

3.11          OQ should include but is not limited to the following:

        i.       Tests that have been developed from the knowledge of processes, systems
                 and equipment to ensure the system is operating as designed;
       ii.       Tests to confirm upper and lower operating limits, and/or “worst case”
                 conditions.

3.12          The completion of a successful OQ should allow the finalisation of standard
              operating and cleaning procedures, operator training and preventative
              maintenance requirements.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                               -215-                            25 August 2023
                                                         Annex 15       Qualification and validation



Performance qualification (PQ)

3.13          PQ should normally follow the successful completion of IQ and OQ. However, it
              may in some cases be appropriate to perform it in conjunction with OQ or Process
              Validation.

3.14          PQ should include, but is not limited to the following:

        i.      Tests, using production materials, qualified substitutes or simulated product
                proven to have equivalent behaviour under normal operating conditions with
                worst case batch sizes. The frequency of sampling used to confirm process
                control should be justified;
        ii.     Tests should cover the operating range of the intended process, unless
                documented evidence from the development phases confirming the
                operational ranges is available.


4.            RE-QUALIFICATION
4.1           Equipment, facilities, utilities and systems should be evaluated at an appropriate
              frequency to confirm that they remain in a state of control.

4.2           Where re-qualification is necessary and performed at a specific time period, the
              period should be justified and the criteria for evaluation defined. Furthermore,
              the possibility of small changes over time should be assessed.



5.             PROCESS VALIDATION
General

5.1           The requirements and principles outlined in this section are applicable to the
              manufacture of all pharmaceutical dosage forms. They cover the initial validation
              of new processes, subsequent validation of modified processes, site transfers
              and ongoing process verification. It is implicit in this annex that a robust product
              development process is in place to enable successful process validation.

5.2           Section 5 should be used in conjunction with relevant guidelines on Process
              Validation1.

5.2.1 A guideline on Process Validation is intended to provide guidance on the
      information and data to be provided in the regulatory submission only. However
      GMP requirements for process validation continue throughout the lifecycle of the
      process
5.2.2 This approach should be applied to link product and process development. It will
      ensure validation of the commercial manufacturing process and maintenance of
      the process in a state of control during routine commercial production.

    PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -216-                             25 August 2023
                                                  Annex 15    Qualification and validation



5.3    Manufacturing processes may be developed using a traditional approach or a
       continuous verification approach. However, irrespective of the approach used,
       processes must be shown to be robust and ensure consistent product quality
       before any product is released to the market. Manufacturing processes using the
       traditional approach should undergo a prospective validation programme
       wherever possible prior to certification of the product. Retrospective validation is
       no longer an acceptable approach.

5.4    Process validation of new products should cover all intended marketed strengths
       and sites of manufacture. Bracketing could be justified for new products based
       on extensive process knowledge from the development stage in conjunction with
       an appropriate ongoing verification programme.

5.5    For the process validation of products, which are transferred from one site to
       another or within the same site, the number of validation batches could be
       reduced by the use of a bracketing approach. However, existing product
       knowledge, including the content of the previous validation, should be available.
       Different strengths, batch sizes and pack sizes/ container types may also use a
       bracketing approach if justified.

5.6    For the site transfer of legacy products, the manufacturing process and controls
       must comply with the marketing authorisation and meet current standards for
       marketing authorisation for that product type. If necessary, variations to the
       marketing authorisation should be submitted.

5.7    Process validation should establish whether all quality attributes and process
       parameters, which are considered important for ensuring the validated state and
       acceptable product quality, can be consistently met by the process. The basis
       by which process parameters and quality attributes were identified as being
       critical or non-critical should be clearly documented, taking into account the
       results of any risk assessment activities.

5.8    Normally batches manufactured for process validation should be the same size
       as the intended commercial scale batches and the use of any other batch sizes
       should be justified or specified in other sections of the GMP guide.

5.9    Equipment, facilities, utilities and systems used for process validation should be
       qualified. Test methods should be validated for their intended use.

5.10   For all products irrespective of the approach used, process knowledge from
       development studies or other sources should be accessible to the manufacturing
       site, unless otherwise justified, and be the basis for validation activities.

5.11   For process validation batches, production, development, or other site transfer
       personnel may be involved. Batches should only be manufactured by trained
       personnel in accordance with GMP using approved documentation. It is expected
       that production personnel are involved in the manufacture of validation batches
       to facilitate product understanding.

5.12   The suppliers of critical starting and packaging materials should be qualified prior
       to the manufacture of validation batches; otherwise a justification based on the
       application of quality risk management principles should be documented.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -217-                           25 August 2023
                                                    Annex 15     Qualification and validation



5.13   It is especially important that the underlying process knowledge for the design
       space justification (if used) and for development of any mathematical models (if
       used) to confirm a process control strategy should be available.

5.14   Where validation batches are released to the market this should be pre-defined.
       The conditions under which they are produced should fully comply with GMP,
       with the validation acceptance criteria, with any continuous process verification
       criteria (if used) and with the marketing authorisation or clinical trial authorisation.

5.15   For the process validation of investigational medicinal products (IMP), please
       refer to Annex 13.

Concurrent validation
5.16   In exceptional circumstances, where there is a strong benefit-risk ratio for the
       patient, it may be acceptable not to complete a validation programme before
       routine production starts and concurrent validation could be used. However, the
       decision to carry out concurrent validation must be justified, documented in the
       VMP for visibility and approved by authorised personnel.

5.17   Where a concurrent validation approach has been adopted, there should be
       sufficient data to support a conclusion that any given batch of product is uniform
       and meets the defined acceptance criteria. The results and conclusion should
       be formally documented and available to the Authorised Person prior to
       certification of the batch.

Traditional process validation
5.18   In the traditional approach, a number of batches of the finished product are
       manufactured under routine conditions to confirm reproducibility.

5.19   The number of batches manufactured and the number of samples taken should
       be based on quality risk management principles, allow the normal range of
       variation and trends to be established and provide sufficient data for evaluation.
       Each manufacturer must determine and justify the number of batches necessary
       to demonstrate a high level of assurance that the process is capable of
       consistently delivering quality product.

5.20   Without prejudice to 5.19, it is generally considered acceptable that a minimum
       of three consecutive batches manufactured under routine conditions could
       constitute a validation of the process. An alternative number of batches may be
       justified taking into account whether standard methods of manufacture are used
       and whether similar products or processes are already used at the site. An initial
       validation exercise with three batches may need to be supplemented with further
       data obtained from subsequent batches as part of an on-going process
       verification exercise.

5.21   A process validation protocol should be prepared which defines the critical
       process parameters (CPP), critical quality attributes (CQA) and the associated
       acceptance criteria which should be based on development data or documented
       process knowledge.

5.22   Process validation protocols should include, but are not limited to the following:



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -218-                            25 August 2023
                                                          Annex 15   Qualification and validation




         i.     A short description of the process and a reference to the respective Master
                Batch Record;
        ii.     Functions and responsibilities;
       iii.     Summary of the CQAs to be investigated;
       iv.      Summary of CPPs and their associated limits;
        v.      Summary of other (non-critical) attributes and parameters which will be
                investigated or monitored during the validation activity, and the reasons for
                their inclusion;
       vi.      List    of  the     equipment/facilities to    be    used    (including
                measuring/monitoring/recording equipment) together with the calibration
                status;
       vii.     List of analytical methods and method validation, as appropriate;
   viii.        Proposed in-process controls with acceptance criteria and the reason(s) why
                each in-process control is selected;
       ix.      Additional testing to be carried out, with acceptance criteria;
        x.      Sampling plan and the rationale behind it;
       xi.      Methods for recording and evaluating results;
       xii.     Process for release and certification of batches (if applicable).


Continuous process verification

5.23          For products developed by a quality by design approach, where it has been
              scientifically established during development that the established control strategy
              provides a high degree of assurance of product quality, then continuous process
              verification can be used as an alternative to traditional process validation.

5.24          The method by which the process will be verified should be defined. There should
              be a science based control strategy for the required attributes for incoming
              materials, critical quality attributes and critical process parameters to confirm
              product realisation. This should also include regular evaluation of the control
              strategy. Process Analytical Technology and multivariate statistical process
              control may be used as tools. Each manufacturer must determine and justify the
              number of batches necessary to demonstrate a high level of assurance that the
              process is capable of consistently delivering quality product.

5.25          The general principles laid down in 5.1 – 5.14 above still apply.


Hybrid approach

5.26          A hybrid of the traditional approach and continuous process verification could be
              used where there is a substantial amount of product and process knowledge and
              understanding which has been gained from manufacturing experience and
              historical batch data.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                              -219-                             25 August 2023
                                                 Annex 15    Qualification and validation



5.27   This approach may also be used for any validation activities after changes or
       during ongoing process verification even though the product was initially
       validated using a traditional approach.

Ongoing Process Verification during Lifecycle

5.28   Paragraphs 5.28-5.32 are applicable to all three approaches to process validation
       mentioned above, i.e. traditional, continuous and hybrid.

5.29   Manufacturers should monitor product quality to ensure that a state of control is
       maintained throughout the product lifecycle with the relevant process trends
       evaluated.

5.30   The extent and frequency of ongoing process verification should be reviewed
       periodically. At any point throughout the product lifecycle, it may be appropriate
       to modify the requirements taking into account the current level of process
       understanding and process performance.

5.31   Ongoing process verification should be conducted under an approved protocol or
       equivalent documents and a corresponding report should be prepared to
       document the results obtained. Statistical tools should be used, where
       appropriate, to support any conclusions with regard to the variability and
       capability of a given process and ensure a state of control.

5.32   Ongoing process verification should be used throughout the product lifecycle to
       support the validated status of the product as documented in the Product Quality
       Review. Incremental changes over time should also be considered and the need
       for any additional actions, e.g. enhanced sampling, should be assessed.


6.     VERIFICATION OF TRANSPORTATION
6.1    Finished medicinal products, investigational medicinal products, bulk product and
       samples should be transported from manufacturing sites in accordance with the
       conditions defined in the marketing authorisation, the approved label, product
       specification file or as justified by the manufacturer.

6.2    It is recognised that verification of transportation may be challenging due to the
       variable factors involved however, transportation routes should be clearly
       defined. Seasonal and other variations should also be considered during
       verification of transport

6.3    A risk assessment should be performed to consider the impact of variables in the
       transportation process other than those conditions which are continuously
       controlled or monitored, e.g. delays during transportation, failure of monitoring
       devices, topping up liquid nitrogen, product susceptibility and any other relevant
       factors.

6.4    Due to the variable conditions expected during transportation, continuous
       monitoring and recording of any critical environmental conditions to which the
       product may be subjected should be performed, unless otherwise justified.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -220-                           25 August 2023
                                                  Annex 15    Qualification and validation




7.     VALIDATION OF PACKAGING
7.1    Variation in equipment processing parameters especially during primary
       packaging may have a significant impact on the integrity and correct functioning
       of the pack, e.g. blister strips, sachets and sterile components; therefore primary
       and secondary packaging equipment for finished and bulk products should be
       qualified.

7.2    Qualification of the equipment used for primary packing should be carried out at
       the minimum and maximum operating ranges defined for the critical process
       parameters such as temperature, machine speed and sealing pressure or for any
       other factors.


8.     QUALIFICATION OF UTILITIES
8.1    The quality of steam, water, air, other gases etc. should be confirmed following
       installation using the qualification steps described in section 3 above.

8.2    The period and extent of qualification should reflect any seasonal variations, if
       applicable, and the intended use of the utility.

8.3    A risk assessment should be carried out where there may be direct contact with
       the product, e.g. heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, or
       indirect contact such as through heat exchangers to mitigate any risks of failure.


9.     VALIDATION OF TEST METHODS
9.1    All analytical test methods used in qualification, validation or cleaning exercises
       should be validated with an appropriate detection and quantification limit, where
       necessary, as defined in Chapter 6 of the PIC/S GMP guide Part I.

9.2    Where microbial testing of product is carried out, the method should be validated
       to confirm that the product does not influence the recovery of microorganisms.

9.3    Where microbial testing of surfaces in clean rooms is carried out, validation
       should be performed on the test method to confirm that sanitising agents do not
       influence the recovery of microorganisms.


10.    CLEANING VALIDATION
10.1   Cleaning validation should be performed in order to confirm the effectiveness of
       any cleaning procedure for all product contact equipment. Simulating agents may
       be used with appropriate scientific justification. Where similar types of equipment
       are grouped together, a justification of the specific equipment selected for
       cleaning validation is expected.

10.2   A visual check for cleanliness is an important part of the acceptance criteria for
       cleaning validation. It is not generally acceptable for this criterion alone to be


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -221-                          25 August 2023
                                                           Annex 15      Qualification and validation



          used. Repeated cleaning and retesting until acceptable residue results are
          obtained is not considered an acceptable approach.

10.3     It is recognised that a cleaning validation programme may take some time to
         complete and validation with verification after each batch may be required for
         some products e.g. investigational medicinal products. There should be sufficient
         data from the verification to support a conclusion that the equipment is clean and
         available for further use.

10.4      Validation should consider the level of automation in the cleaning process. Where
          an automatic process is used, the specified normal operating range of the utilities
          and equipment should be validated.

10.5      For all cleaning processes an assessment should be performed to determine the
          variable factors which influence cleaning effectiveness and performance, e.g.
          operators, the level of detail in procedures such as rinsing times etc. If variable
          factors have been identified, the worst case situations should be used as the
          basis for cleaning validation studies.

10.6      Limits for the carryover of product residues should be based on a toxicological
          evaluation2. The justification for the selected limits should be documented in a
          risk assessment which includes all the supporting references. Limits should be
          established for the removal of any cleaning agents used. Acceptance criteria
          should consider the potential cumulative effect of multiple items of equipment in
          the process equipment train.

10.6.1 Therapeutic macromolecules and peptides are known to degrade and denature
       when exposed to pH extremes and/or heat, and may become pharmacologically
       inactive. A toxicological evaluation may therefore not be applicable in these
       circumstances.
10.6.2 If it is not feasible to test for specific product residues, other representative
       parameters may be selected, e.g. total organic carbon (TOC) and conductivity.

10.7      The risk presented by microbial and endotoxin contamination should be
          considered during the development of cleaning validation protocols.

10.8      The influence of the time between manufacture and cleaning and the time
          between cleaning and use should be taken into account to define dirty and clean
          hold times for the cleaning process.

10.9      Where campaign manufacture is carried out, the impact on the ease of cleaning
          at the end of the campaign should be considered and the maximum length of a
          campaign (in time and/or number of batches) should be the basis for cleaning
          validation exercises.

10.10 Where a worst case product approach is used as a cleaning validation model, a
      scientific rationale should be provided for the selection of the worst case product
      and the impact of new products to the site assessed. Criteria for determining the
      worst case may include solubility, cleanability, toxicity, and potency.

          identification in the manufacture of different medicinal products in shared facilities



    PE 009-17 (Annexes)                           -222-                                25 August 2023
                                                 Annex 15   Qualification and validation




10.11 Cleaning validation protocols should specify or reference the locations to be
      sampled, the rationale for the selection of these locations and define the
      acceptance criteria.

10.12 Sampling should be carried out by swabbing and/or rinsing or by other means
      depending on the production equipment. The sampling materials and method
      should not influence the result. Recovery should be shown to be possible from
      all product contact materials sampled in the equipment with all the sampling
      methods used.

10.13 The cleaning procedure should be performed an appropriate number of times
      based on a risk assessment and meet the acceptance criteria in order to prove
      that the cleaning method is validated.

10.14 Where a cleaning process is ineffective or is not appropriate for some equipment,
      dedicated equipment or other appropriate measures should be used for each
      product as indicated in chapters 3 and 5 of the PIC/S GMP Guide.

10.15 Where manual cleaning of equipment is performed, it is especially important that
      the effectiveness of the manual process should be confirmed at a justified
      frequency.



11.    CHANGE CONTROL
11.1   The control of change is an important part of knowledge management and should
       be handled within the pharmaceutical quality system.

11.2   Written procedures should be in place to describe the actions to be taken if a
       planned change is proposed to a starting material, product component, process,
       equipment, premises, product range, method of production or testing, batch size,
       design space or any other change during the lifecycle that may affect product
       quality or reproducibility.

11.3   Where design space is used, the impact on changes to the design space should
       be considered against the registered design space within the marketing
       authorisation and the need for any regulatory actions assessed.

11.4   Quality risk management should be used to evaluate planned changes to
       determine the potential impact on product quality, pharmaceutical quality
       systems, documentation, validation, regulatory status, calibration, maintenance
       and on any other system to avoid unintended consequences and to plan for any
       necessary process validation, verification or requalification efforts.

11.5   Changes should be authorised and approved by the responsible persons or
       relevant functional personnel in accordance with the pharmaceutical quality
       system.

11.6   Supporting data, e.g. copies of documents, should be reviewed to confirm that
       the impact of the change has been demonstrated prior to final approval.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -223-                         25 August 2023
                                                   Annex 15    Qualification and validation




11.7   Following implementation, and where appropriate, an evaluation of the
       effectiveness of change should be carried out to confirm that the change has
       been successful.


12. GLOSSARY
Definitions of terms relating to qualification and validation which are not given in other
sections of the current PIC/S Guide to GMP are given below.

Bracketing approach:
       A science and risk based validation approach such that only batches on the
       extremes of certain predetermined and justified design factors, e.g. strength,
       batch size, and/or pack size, are tested during process validation. The design
       assumes that validation of any intermediate levels is represented by validation of
       the extremes. Where a range of strengths is to be validated, bracketing could be
       applicable if the strengths are identical or very closely related in composition, e.g.
       for a tablet range made with different compression weights of a similar basic
       granulation, or a capsule range made by filling different plug fill weights of the
       same basic composition into different size capsule shells. Bracketing can be
       applied to different container sizes or different fills in the same container closure
       system.
Change Control
       A formal system by which qualified representatives of appropriate disciplines
       review proposed or actual changes that might affect the validated status of
       facilities, systems, equipment or processes. The intent is to determine the need
       for action to ensure and document that the system is maintained in a validated
       state.
Cleaning Validation
       Cleaning validation is documented evidence that an approved cleaning procedure
       will reproducibly remove the previous product or cleaning agents used in the
       equipment below the scientifically set maximum allowable carryover level.
Cleaning verification
       The gathering of evidence through chemical analysis after each batch/campaign
       to show that the residues of the previous product or cleaning agents have been
       reduced below the scientifically set maximum allowable carryover level.

Concurrent Validation
     Validation carried out in exceptional circumstances, justified on the basis of
     significant patient benefit, where the validation protocol is executed concurrently
     with commercialisation of the validation batches.
Continuous process verification
       An alternative approach to process validation in which manufacturing process
       performance is continuously monitored and evaluated. (ICH Q8)




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -224-                            25 August 2023
                                                  Annex 15    Qualification and validation



Control Strategy:
       A planned set of controls, derived from current product and process
       understanding that ensures process performance and product quality. The
       controls can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and
       drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating
       conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the
       associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control. (ICH Q10)
Critical process parameter (CPP)
       A process parameter whose variability has an impact on a critical quality attribute
       and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces
       the desired quality. (ICH Q8)
Critical quality attribute (CQA)
       A physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or characteristic that
       should be within an approved limit, range or distribution to ensure the desired
       product quality. (ICH Q8)
Design qualification (DQ)
       The documented verification that the proposed design of the facilities, systems
       and equipment is suitable for the intended purpose.
Design Space
       The multidimensional combination and interaction of input variables, e.g. material
       attributes, and process parameters that have been demonstrated to provide
       assurance of quality. Working within the design space is not considered as a
       change. Movement out of the design space is considered to be a change and
       would normally initiate a regulatory post approval change process. Design space
       is proposed by the applicant and is subject to regulatory assessment and
       approval. (ICH Q8)
Installation Qualification (IQ)
       The documented verification that the facilities, systems and equipment, as
       installed or modified, comply with the approved design and the manufacturer’s
       recommendations.
Knowledge management
       A systematic approach to acquire, analyse, store and disseminate information.
       (ICH Q10)
Lifecycle
       All phases in the life of a product, equipment or facility from initial development
       or use through to discontinuation of use.
Ongoing Process Verification (also known as continued process verification)
       Documented evidence that the process remains in a state of control during
       commercial manufacture.
Operational Qualification (OQ)
       The documented verification that the facilities, systems and equipment, as
       installed or modified, perform as intended throughout the anticipated operating
       ranges.

Performance Qualification (PQ)
       The documented verification that systems and equipment can perform effectively
       and reproducibly based on the approved process method and product
       specification.
Process Validation
       The documented evidence that the process, operated within established
       parameters, can perform effectively and reproducibly to produce a medicinal
       product meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes.
Product realisation
       Achievement of a product with the quality attributes to meet the needs of patients,
       health care professionals and regulatory authorities and internal customer
       requirements. (ICH Q10)
Prospective Validation
       Validation carried out before routine production of products intended for sale.
Quality by design
       A systematic approach that begins with predefined objectives and emphasises
       product and process understanding and process control, based on sound science
       and quality risk management.

       risks to quality across the lifecycle. (ICH Q9)
Simulated agents
       A material that closely approximates the physical and, where practical, the
       chemical characteristics, e.g. viscosity, particle size, pH etc., of the product under
       validation.
State of control
       A condition in which the set of controls consistently provides assurance of
       acceptable process performance and product quality.
Traditional approach
       A product development approach where set points and operating ranges for
       process parameters are defined to ensure reproducibility.
User requirements Specification (URS)
       The set of owner, user, and engineering requirements necessary and sufficient
       to create a feasible design meeting the intended purpose of the system.
Worst Case
       A condition or set of conditions encompassing upper and lower processing limits
       and circumstances, within standard operating procedures, which pose the
       greatest chance of product or process failure when compared to ideal conditions.
       Such conditions do not necessarily induce product or process failure.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -226-                            25 August 2023
                                     Annex 16    Authorised person and batch release



ANNEX 16


CERTIFICATION BY THE AUTHORISED PERSON AND
               BATCH RELEASE


SCOPE
      This Annex provides guidance on the certification by an Authorised Person and
      on batch release of medicinal products for human or veterinary use within a
      Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) Participating Authority
      or made for export. The principles of this guidance also apply to investigational
      medicinal products (IMP) for human use, subject to any difference in the legal
      provisions and more specific guidance published by PIC/S Participating
      Authorities under national law.

      Guidance in this Annex on the certification of batches by a manufacturer of a
      medicinal product is within the scope of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-
      operation Scheme. However, each PIC/S Participating Authority may decide
      whether guidance expressed in this annex should become a legally-binding
      standard in relation to imported medicinal products.

      This Annex does not address any controls on release of medicinal products by a
      National Competent Authority under national law (e.g. certain blood and
      immunological products); however, this Annex does apply to the Authorised
      Person certification and subsequent release of such batches.

      The basic arrangements for batch release for a medicinal product are defined by
      its marketing authorisation (MA). Nothing in this Annex should be taken as
      overriding those arrangements.


GENERAL PRINCIPLES
      The ultimate responsibility for the performance of a medicinal product over its
      lifetime, its safety, quality and efficacy, lies with the marketing authorisation
      holder (MAH).

      However, the Authorised Person is responsible for ensuring that each individual
      batch has been manufactured and checked in compliance with national
      requirements in accordance with the requirements of the marketing authorisation
      (MA) and with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).

      The process of batch release comprises of:

        i.   The checking of the manufacture and testing of the batch in accordance
             with defined release procedures.




PE 009-17 (Annexes)                     -227-                          25 August 2023
                                             Annex 16      Authorised person and batch release



            ii.   The certification of the finished product batch performed by an Authorised
                  Person signifying that the batch is in compliance with GMP and the
                  requirements of its MA. This represents the quality release of the batch.
           iii.   The transfer to saleable stock, and/or export of the finished batch of
                  product which should take into account the certification performed by the
                  Authorised Person. If this transfer is performed at a site other than that
                  where certification takes place, then the arrangement should be
                  documented in a written agreement between the sites.

          The purpose of controlling batch release is notably to ensure that:

             i.   The batch has been manufactured and checked in accordance with the
                  requirements of its MA.
            ii.   The batch has been manufactured and checked in accordance with the
                  principles and guidelines of GMP.
           iii.   Any other relevant legal requirements are taken into account.
           iv.    In the event that a quality defect as referred to in Chapter 8 of PIC/S GMP
                  Guide, Part I, needs to be investigated or a batch recalled, to ensure that
                  any Authorised Persons involved in the certification or confirmation1 and
                  any relevant records are readily identifiable.


1.        THE PROCESS OF CERTIFICATION
1.1.      Each batch of finished product must be certified2 by an Authorised Person before
          being released for sale, supply or export. Certification can only be performed by
          an Authorised Person of the manufacturer and/or importer which are described
          in the MA.

1.2.      Any Authorised Person involved in the certification or confirmation of a batch
          must have detailed knowledge of the steps for which they are taking
          responsibility. The Authorised Persons should be able to prove their continuous
          training regarding the product type, production processes, technical advances
          and changes to GMP.

1.3.      There may be several sites involved in the various stages of manufacture,
          importation, testing and storage of a batch before it undergoes certification.
          Regardless of how many sites are involved, the Authorised Person performing
          certification of the finished product must ensure that all necessary steps have
          been completed under accepted pharmaceutical quality systems to assure
          compliance of the batch with GMP, the MA and any other national requirements
          where certification is taking place.




1         Information required for the confirmation, where Authorised Person responsibilities for the
          batch are being transferred between sites, is recommended in Appendix I to this Annex.
2         The contents of a batch certificate for medicinal products are recommended in Appendix
          II to this Annex. The content of a batch certificate may differ from Appendix II as required
          under national law or as required to facilitate arrangements between National Competent
          Authorities.


    PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -228-                              25 August 2023
                                        Annex 16     Authorised person and batch release



1.4.    Each manufacturing site must have at least one Authorised Person.

1.4.1   Where the site only undertakes partial manufacturing operations in relation to a
        batch, then an Authorised Person at that site must at least confirm that the
        operations undertaken by the site have been performed in accordance with GMP
        and the terms of the written agreement detailing the operations for which the site
        is responsible. If the Authorised Person is responsible for providing confirmation
        of compliance for those operations with the relevant MA, then the Authorised
        Person should have access to the necessary details of the MA.

1.4.2   The Authorised Person who performs certification of the finished product batch
        should assume full responsibility for all stages of manufacture of the batch or this
        responsibility may be shared with other Authorised Persons who have provided
        confirmation for specified steps in the manufacture and control of a batch. These
        could be other Authorised Persons who are operating under the same
        manufacturing authorisation holder or operating under different manufacturing
        authorisation holders

1.4.3   Any sharing of responsibilities amongst Authorised Persons in relation to
        compliance of a batch must be defined in a written agreement. This document
        should detail responsibility for assessment of the impact any deviation(s)
        has/have on compliance of the batch with GMP and the MA.

1.5     For medicinal products manufactured outside the jurisdiction of a National
        Competent Authority, physical importation and certification are the final stages of
        manufacturing which precede the transfer to saleable stock of the batch,
        depending on national law.

1.5.1   The process of certification as described in Section 1 of this Annex, applies to all
        medicinal products intended to be released within domestic markets, or for
        export, irrespective of the complexity of the supply chain and the global locations
        of manufacturing sites involved.

1.5.2   In accordance with the principles described in Section 1.4 of this Annex and the
        law in each jurisdiction, the Authorised Person certifying the finished medicinal
        product batch may take account of the confirmation by, and share defined
        responsibilities with, other Authorised Persons in relation to any manufacturing
        or importation operations taking place at other sites in the same jurisdiction and
        other manufacturing authorisation holders defined in the relevant MA.

1.5.3   Conditions of storage and transport for the batch and the sample, if sent
        separately, should be taken into account by the Authorised Person before
        certification of a batch.

1.5.4   The Authorised Person certifying the finished product is responsible for ensuring
        that each finished medicinal product batch has been manufactured in accordance
        with GMP and the MA. The Authorised Person is also responsible for ensuring
        that the finished medicinal product batch has undergone testing required upon
        importation in accordance with national law.

1.5.5   If sampling of imported product is necessary, it should be fully representative of
        the batch. Samples may either be taken after arrival in the jurisdiction of the
        National Competent Authority, or be taken at the manufacturing site located in


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -229-                           25 August 2023
                                        Annex 16     Authorised person and batch release



        another jurisdiction in accordance with national law and a technically justified
        approach which is documented within the company’s quality system.
        Responsibilities in relation to the sampling should be defined in a written
        agreement between the sites. Any samples taken outside the National
        Competent Authority jurisdiction should be shipped under equivalent transport
        conditions as the batch that they represent.

1.5.6   Where sampling is performed at a manufacturing site located in another
        jurisdiction, the technical justification should include a formal Quality Risk
        Management process to identify and manage any risks associated with this
        approach. This should be fully documented and include at least the following
        elements:

          i.    Audit of the manufacturing activity including any sampling activity in the
                other jurisdiction and evaluation of subsequent transportation steps of
                both the batch and samples to ensure that the samples are representative
                of the imported batch.
         ii.    A comprehensive scientific study, including data to support any
                conclusions that samples taken in the other jurisdiction are representative
                of the batch after importation. This study should at least include:
                     description of the sampling process in the other jurisdiction;
                     description of the transported conditions of the sample and the
                       imported batch. Any differences should be justified;
                     comparative analysis of samples taken in the other jurisdiction and
                       samples taken after importation; and
                     consideration of the time interval between sampling and importation
                       of the batch and generation of data to support appropriate defined
                       limits.
         iii.   Provision for random periodic analysis of samples taken after importation
                to justify ongoing reliance on samples taken in another jurisdiction.
         iv.    A review of any unexpected result or confirmed out of specification result.
                These may have implications for reliance on sampling performed at a
                manufacturing site located in another jurisdiction and should be notified to
                the National Competent Authority for the site where certification is
                performed. Such an occurrence should be regarded as a potential quality
                defect and investigated in line with the guidance in Chapter 8 of the PIC/S
                GMP Guide, Part I.

1.5.7   Different imported finished product batches may originate from the same bulk
        product batch. If testing upon importation is required (see 1.5.4), the Authorised
        Person(s) certifying the different finished product batches may base their decision
        on the quality control testing of the first imported finished batch provided that a
        justification has been documented based on Quality Risk Management
        principles. This should take into account the provisions of paragraph 1.5.6 in
        relation to reliance on any samples taken in another jurisdiction. Evidence should
        be available to ensure that the integrity and identity of the imported finished
        product batch has been established through documented verification of at least
        the following:

          i.    relevant requirements for storage of the bulk product prior to packaging
                have been satisfied;


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -230-                           25 August 2023
                                        Annex 16     Authorised person and batch release



         ii.    the finished product batch has been stored and transported under the
                required conditions;
         iii.   the consignment has remained secure and there is no evidence of
                tampering during storage or transportation;
         iv.    correct identification of the product has been established; and
          v.    the sample(s) tested are representative of all finished product batches
                derived from the bulk batch.

1.6     The Authorised Person must ensure that the following operational responsibilities
        are fulfilled prior to certification of a batch:

          i.    Certification is permitted under the terms of any authorisation by the
                national competent authority.
          ii.   Any additional duties and requirements of national law are complied with.
         iii.   Certification is recorded in accordance with this Annex and in accordance
                to national law.

1.7     In addition, the Authorised Person has responsibility for ensuring points 1.7.1 to
        1.7.21 are secured. These tasks may be delegated to appropriately trained
        personnel or third parties. It is recognised that the Authorised Person will need to
        rely on the pharmaceutical quality system and the Authorised Person should have
        on-going assurance that this reliance is well founded.

1.7.1   All activities associated with manufacture and testing of the medicinal product
        have been conducted in accordance with the principles and guidelines of GMP.

1.7.2   The entire supply chain of the active substance and medicinal product up to the
        stage of certification is documented and available for the Authorised Person. This
        should include the manufacturing sites of the starting materials and packaging
        materials for the medicinal product and any other materials deemed critical
        through a risk assessment of the manufacturing process. The document should
        preferably be in the format of a comprehensive diagram, where each party,
        including subcontractors of critical steps such as the sterilisation of components
        and equipment for aseptic processing, are included.

1.7.3   All audits of sites involved in the manufacture and the testing of the medicinal
        products and in the manufacture of the active substance have been carried out

 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -232-                          25 August 2023
                                        Annex 16     Authorised person and batch release




1.7.21 Where required in national law, safety features have been affixed to the
       packaging enabling wholesale distributors and persons authorised or entitled to
       supply medicinal products to the public to:

           i.   verify the authenticity of the medicinal product;
          ii.   identify individual packs; and
         iii.   verify, via a device, of whether the outer packaging has been tampered
                with.

1.8     For certain products, special guidance may apply, such as PIC/S GMP Guide
        Annex 2: Manufacture of Biological active substances and Medicinal Products for
        Human Use, and Annex 3: Manufacture of Radiopharmaceuticals.

1.9     In the case of parallel importation and parallel distribution, any repackaging
        operation carried out on a batch which has already been released must be
        approved by the competent authority of the intended market, as applicable under
        national law.

1.9.1   Prior to certification of a repacked batch the Authorised Person should confirm
        compliance with national requirements for parallel importation and rules for
        parallel distribution.

1.9.2   The Authorised Person, who is responsible for the certification of the batch in the
        MA of the repackaged finished product, certifies that the repackaging has been
        performed in accordance with the relevant authorisation pertaining to the
        repackaged product and GMP.

1.10    Recording of Authorised Person certification:

1.10.1 The certification of a medicinal product is recorded by the Authorised Person in
       the document provided for that purpose. The record should show that each
       production batch satisfies the following provisions:

          i.    Each batch of medicinal products has been manufactured and checked in
                compliance with national law and in accordance with the requirements of
                the marketing authorisation.
         ii.    In the case of medicinal products coming from another jurisdiction each
                production batch has a full qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis of
                at least all the active substances and all the other tests or checks
                necessary to ensure the quality of medicinal products in accordance with
                the requirements of the marketing authorisation. Such testing is also
                performed in the importing country where required in national law.
         iii.   In the case of medicinal products imported from another jurisdiction,
                where appropriate arrangements have been made with the exporting
                jurisdiction to ensure that the manufacturer of the medicinal product
                applies standards of good manufacturing practice at least equivalent to
                those laid down by the national competent authority, and to ensure that
                the controls referred to under point (ii) have been carried out in the
                exporting country, the authorised person may be relieved of responsibility
                for carrying out those controls.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -233-                           25 August 2023
                                       Annex 16    Authorised person and batch release



        iv.    The record must be kept up to date as operations are carried out and must
               remain at the disposal of the agents of the National Competent Authority
               the longer of one year after expiry of the batch or five years unless
               otherwise specified in national law.

1.10.2 The control report referred to in 1.10.1 or another proof for release for sale,
       supply, or export, based on an equivalent system, should be made available for
       the batch in order to be exempted from further controls when entering another
       National Competent Authority jurisdiction.


2. RELYING ON GMP ASSESSMENTS BY THIRD PARTIES, E.G.
AUDITS
       In some cases the Authorised Person will rely on the correct functioning of the
       pharmaceutical quality system of sites involved in the manufacture of the product
       and this may be derived from audits conducted by third parties.

2.1    Relying on assessment by third parties, e.g. audits should be in accordance with
       Chapter 7 of the PIC/S GMP Guide in order to appropriately define, agree and
       control any outsourced activity.

2.2    Special focus should be given to the approval of audit reports:

          i.   The audit report should address general GMP requirements, as for
               example the quality management system, all relevant production and
               quality control procedures related to the supplied product, e.g. active
               substance manufacturing, quality control testing, primary packaging, etc.
               All audited areas should be accurately described resulting in a detailed
               report of the audit.
         ii.   It should be determined whether the manufacture and quality control of
               the active substance and medicinal product complies with GMP or in case
               of manufacture in another jurisdiction, GMP at least equivalent to that of
               each National Competent Authority.
        iii.   In case of outsourced activities compliance with the MA should be verified.
        iv.    The Authorised Person should ensure that a written final assessment and
               approval of third party audit reports have been made. The Authorised
               Person should have access to all documentation which facilitates review
               of the audit outcome and continued reliance on the outsourced activity.
        v.     Outsourced activities with critical impact on product quality should be
               defined in accordance with the principles of Quality Risk Management as
               described in Annex 20 of the PIC/S GMP Guide. According to this, the
               Authorised Person should be aware of the outcome of an audit with critical
               impact on the product quality before certifying the relevant batches.
        vi.    Repeated audits should be performed in accordance with the principles of
               Quality Risk Management.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -234-                           25 August 2023
                                       Annex 16     Authorised person and batch release



3. HANDLING OF UNEXPECTED DEVIATIONS
       Provided registered specifications for active substances, excipients, packaging
       materials and medicinal products are met, an Authorised Person may consider
       confirming compliance or certifying a batch where an unexpected deviation
       concerning the manufacturing process and/or the analytical control methods from
       details contained within the MA and/or GMP has occurred. The deviation should
       be thoroughly investigated and the root cause corrected. This may require the
       submission of a variation to the MA for the continued manufacture of the product.

3.1    The impact of the deviation should be assessed in accordance with a quality risk
       management process using an appropriate approach such as described in Annex
       20 of the PIC/S GMP Guide. The quality risk management process should include
       the following;

         i.    Evaluation of the potential impact of the deviation on quality, safety or
               efficacy of the batch(es) concerned and conclusion that the impact is
               negligible.
        ii.    Consideration of the need to include the affected batch(es) in the ongoing
               stability programme.
        iii.   In the case of biological medicinal products, consideration that any
               deviations from the approved process can have an unexpected impact on
               safety and efficacy.

       Taking account that responsibilities may be shared between more than one
       Authorised Person involved in the manufacture and control of a batch, the
       Authorised Person performing certification of a batch of medicinal product should
       be aware of and take into consideration any deviations which have the potential
       to impact compliance with GMP and/or compliance with the MA.


4. THE RELEASE OF A BATCH
4.1    Batches of medicinal products should only be released for sale or supply to the
       market after certification by an Authorised Person as described above. Until a
       batch is certified, it should remain at the site of manufacture or be shipped under
       quarantine to another site which has been approved for that purpose by the
       relevant National Competent Authority.

4.2    Safeguards to ensure that uncertified batches are not transferred to saleable
       stock should be in place and may be physical in nature, e.g. the use of
       segregation and labelling or electronic in nature, e.g. the use of validated
       computerised systems. When uncertified batches are moved from one authorised
       site to another, the safeguards to prevent premature release should remain.

4.3    The steps necessary to notify Authorised Person certification to the site where
       the transfer to saleable stock is to take place should be defined within a technical
       agreement. Such notification by an Authorised Person to the site should be formal
       and unambiguous and should be subject to the requirements of Chapter 4 of the
       PIC/S GMP Guide, Part I.

                                       Annex 16     Authorised person and batch release



4.4    National law may require a specific release for the local market (market release)
       by the MAH which takes into consideration the certification of the finished product
       by the manufacturer.

                                  Annex 17     Real Time Release & Parametric Release



ANNEX 17

               REAL TIME RELEASE TESTING AND
                    PARAMETRIC RELEASE


1.     PRINCIPLE
1.1    Medicinal products must comply with their approved specifications and subject to
       compliance with GMP, can normally be released to market by performing a
       complete set of tests on active substances and/or finished products as defined in
       the relevant marketing authorisation or clinical trial authorisation. In specific
       circumstances, where authorised, based on product knowledge and process
       understanding, information collected during the manufacturing process can be
       used instead of end-product testing for batch release. Any separate activities
       required for this form of batch release should be integrated into the
       Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS).


2.     SCOPE
2.1    This document is intended to outline the requirements for application of Real
       Time Release Testing (RTRT) and parametric release, where the control of
       critical parameters and relevant material attributes are authorised as an
       alternative to routine end-product testing of active substances and/or finished
       products. A specific aim of this guideline is to incorporate the application of RTRT
       to any stage in the manufacturing process and to any type of finished products or
       active substances, including their intermediates.


3.     REAL TIME RELEASE TESTING (RTRT)
3.1    Under RTRT, a combination of in-process monitoring and controls may provide,
       when authorised, a substitute for end-product testing as part of the batch release
       decision. Interaction with all relevant regulatory authorities prior and during the
       assessment process preceding regulatory approval is required. The level of
       interaction will depend on the level of complexity of the RTRT control procedure
       applied on site.

3.2    When designing the RTRT strategy, the following minimum criteria are expected
       to be established and met:

      (i)     Real time measurement and control of relevant in-process material
              attributes and process parameters should be accurate predictors of the
              corresponding finished product attributes.
      (ii)    The valid combination of relevant assessed material attributes and
              process controls to replace finished product attributes should be
              established with scientific evidence based on material, product and
              process knowledge.


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                      -239-                           25 August 2023
                                  Annex 17     Real Time Release & Parametric Release



      (iii)   The combined process measurements (process parameters and material
              attributes) and any other test data generated during the manufacturing
              process should provide a robust foundation for RTRT and the batch
              release decision.

3.3    A RTRT strategy should be integrated and controlled through the PQS. This
       should include or reference information at least of the following:
        -       quality risk management, including a full process related risk
                assessment, in accordance with the principles described in the PIC/S
                Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products, Part I
                Chapter 1 and Part II Chapter 2,
        -       change control program,
        -       control strategy,
        -       specific personnel training program,
        -       qualification and validation policy,
        -       deviation/CAPA system,
        -       contingency procedure in case of a process sensor/equipment failure,
        -       periodic review/assessment program to measure the effectiveness of the
                RTRT plan for continued assurance of product quality.

3.4    In accordance with the principles described in the PIC/S Guide to Good
       Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products, Part I Chapter 1, Part II Chapter
       13 and Annex 15, the change control program is an important part of the real time
       release testing approach. Any change that could potentially impact product
       manufacturing and testing, or the validated status of facilities, systems,
       equipment, analytical methods or processes, should be assessed for risk to
       product quality and impact on reproducibility of the manufacturing process. Any
       change should be justified by the sound application of quality risk management
       principles, and fully documented. After change implementation, an evaluation
       should be undertaken to demonstrate that there are no unintended or deleterious
       impact on product quality.

3.5    A control strategy should be designed not only to monitor the process, but also
       to maintain a state of control and ensure that a product of the required quality will
       be consistently produced. The control strategy should describe and justify the
       selected in-process controls, material attributes and process parameters which
       require to be routinely monitored and should be based on product, formulation
       and process understanding. The control strategy is dynamic and may change
       throughout the lifecycle of the product requiring the use of a quality risk
       management approach and of knowledge management. The control strategy
       should also describe the sampling plan and acceptance/rejection criteria.

3.6    Personnel should be given specific training on RTRT technologies, principles and
       procedures. Key personnel should demonstrate adequate experience, product
       and process knowledge and understanding. Successful implementation of RTRT
       requires input from a cross-functional/multi-disciplinary team with relevant
       experience on specific topics, such as engineering, analytics, chemometric
       modeling or statistics.

3.7    Important parts of the RTRT strategy are validation and qualification policy, with
       particular reference to advanced analytical methods. Particular attention should
       be focused on the qualification, validation and management of in-line and on-line



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -240-                           25 August 2023
                                    Annex 17     Real Time Release & Parametric Release



       analytical methods, where the sampling probe is placed within the manufacturing
       equipment.

3.8    Any deviation or process failure should be thoroughly investigated and any
       adverse trending indicating a change in the state of control should be followed up
       appropriately.

3.9    Continuous learning through data collection and analysis over the life cycle of a
       product is important and should be part of the PQS. With advances in technology,
       certain data trends, intrinsic to a currently acceptable process, may be observed.
       Manufacturers should scientifically evaluate the data, in consultation if
       appropriate, with the regulatory authorities, to determine how or if such trends
       indicate opportunities to improve quality and/or consistency.

3.10   When RTRT has been approved, this approach should be routinely used for
       batch release. In the event that the results from RTRT fail or are trending toward
       failure, a RTRT approach may not be substituted by end-product testing. Any
       failure should be thoroughly investigated and considered in the batch release
       decision depending on the results of these investigations, and must comply with
       the content of the marketing authorisation and GMP requirements. Trends should
       be followed up appropriately.

3.11   Attributes (e.g. uniformity of content) that are indirectly controlled by approved
       RTRT should still appear in the Certificate of Analysis for batches. The approved
       method for testing the end-product should be mentioned and the results given as
       “Complies if tested” with a footnote: “Controlled by approved Real Time Release
       Testing”.


4.     PARAMETRIC RELEASE AND STERILISATION

4.1    This section provides guidance on parametric release which is defined as the
       release of a batch of terminally sterilised product based on a review of critical
       process control parameters rather than requiring an end-product testing for
       sterility.

4.2    An end-product test for sterility is limited in its ability to detect contamination as it
       utilises only a small number of samples in relation to the overall batch size, and
       secondly, culture media may only stimulate growth of some, but not all,
       microorganisms. Therefore, an end-product testing for sterility only provides an
       opportunity to detect major failures in the sterility assurance system (i.e. a failure
       that results in contamination of a large number of product units and/or that result
       in contamination by the specific microorganisms whose growth is supported by
       the prescribed media). In contrast, data derived from in-process controls (e.g.
       pre-sterilisation product bioburden or environmental monitoring) and by
       monitoring relevant sterilisation parameters can provide more accurate and
       relevant information to support sterility assurance of the product.

4.3    Parametric release can only be applied to products sterilised in their final
       container using either moist heat, dry heat or ionising radiation (dosimetric
       release).




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -241-                             25 August 2023
                                   Annex 17     Real Time Release & Parametric Release



4.4    To utilise this approach, the manufacturer should have a history of acceptable
       GMP compliance and a robust sterility assurance program in place to
       demonstrate consistent process control and process understanding.

4.5    The sterility assurance program should be documented and include, at least, the
       identification and monitoring of the critical process parameters, steriliser cycle
       development and validation, container/packaging integrity validation, bioburden
       control, environmental monitoring program, product segregation plan, equipment,
       services and facility design and qualification program, maintenance and
       calibration program, change control program, personnel training, and incorporate
       a quality risk management approach.

4.6    Risk management is an essential requirement for parametric release and should
       focus on mitigating the factors which increase the risk of failure to achieve and
       maintain sterility in each unit of every batch. If a new product or process is being
       considered for parametric release, then a risk assessment should be conducted
       during process development including an evaluation of production data from
       existing products if applicable. If an existing product or process is being
       considered, the risk assessment should include an evaluation of any historical
       data generated.

4.7    Personnel involved in the parametric release process should have experience in
       the following areas: microbiology, sterility assurance, engineering, production
       and sterilisation. The qualifications, experience, competency and training of all
       personnel involved in parametric release should be documented.

4.8    Any proposed change which may impact on sterility assurance should be
       recorded in the change control system and reviewed by appropriate personnel
       who are qualified and experienced in sterility assurance.

4.9    A pre-sterilisation bio-burden monitoring program for the product and
       components should be developed to support parametric release. The bioburden
       should be performed for each batch. The sampling locations of filled units before
       sterilization should be based on a worst-case scenario and be representative of
       the batch. Any organisms found during bioburden testing should be identified to
       confirm that they are not spore forming which may be more resistant to the
       sterilising process.

4.10   Product bio-burden should be minimised by appropriate design of the
       manufacturing environment and the process by:
        -     good equipment and facility design to allow effective cleaning,
              disinfection and sanitisation;
        -     availability of detailed and effective procedures for cleaning, disinfection
              and sanitisation;
        -     use of microbial retentive filters where possible;
        -     availability of operating practices and procedures which promote
              personnel hygiene and enforce appropriate garment control;
        -     appropriate microbiological specifications for raw materials,
              intermediates and process aids (e.g. gases)

4.11   For aqueous or otherwise microbiologically unstable products, the time lag
       between dissolving the starting materials, product fluid filtration, and sterilisation



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -242-                            25 August 2023
                                  Annex 17     Real Time Release & Parametric Release



       should be defined in order to minimise the development of bioburden and an
       increase in endotoxins (if applicable).

Sterilisation Process

4.12   Qualification and validation are critical activities to assure that sterilisation
       equipment can consistently meet cycle operational parameters and that the
       monitoring devices provide verification of the sterilisation process.

4.13   Periodic requalification of equipment and revalidation of processes should be
       planned and justified in accordance with the requirements of the PIC/S Guide to
       Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products Annexes 1 and 15.

4.14   Appropriate measurement of critical process parameters during sterilisation is a
       critical requirement in a parametric release program. The standards used for
       process measuring devices should be specified and the calibration should be
       traceable to national or international standards.

4.15   Critical process parameters should be established, defined and undergo periodic
       re-evaluation. The operating ranges should be developed based on sterilisation
       process, process capability, calibration tolerance limits and parameter criticality.

4.16   Routine monitoring of the steriliser should demonstrate that the validated
       conditions necessary to achieve the specified process is achieved in each cycle.
       Critical processes should be specifically monitored during the sterilisation phase.

4.17   The sterilisation record should include all the critical process parameters. The
       sterilisation records should be checked for compliance to specification by at least
       two independent systems. These systems may consist of two people or a
       validated computer system plus a person.

4.18   Once parametric release has been approved by the regulatory authorities,
       decisions for release or rejection of a batch should be based on the approved
       specifications and the review of critical process control data. Routine checks of
       the steriliser, changes, deviations, unplanned and routine planned maintenance
       activities should be recorded, assessed and approved before releasing the
       products to the market. Non-compliance with the specification for parametric
       release cannot be overruled by a finished product passing the test for sterility.


5.     GLOSSARY

       Control strategy
       A planned set of controls, derived from current product and process
       understanding that ensures process performance and product quality. The
       controls can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and
       drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating
       conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the
       associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control.

                                 Annex 17     Real Time Release & Parametric Release



      Critical Process Parameters:
      A process parameter whose variability has an impact on a critical quality attribute
      and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces
      the desired quality [ICH Q8 (R2)].

      Critical Quality Attributes
      A physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property or characteristic that
      should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired
      product quality. [ICH Q8 (R2)]

      Parametric release
      One form of RTRT. Parametric release for terminally sterilised product is based
      on the review of documentation on process monitoring (e.g. temperature,
      pressure, time for terminal sterilisation) rather than the testing of a sample for a
      specific attribute (ICH Q8 Q&A).

      Real time release testing
      The ability to evaluate and ensure the quality of in-process and/or final product
      based on process data, which typically include a valid combination of measured
      material attributes and process controls. (ICH Q8)

      State of Control
      A condition in which the set of controls consistently provides assurance of
      continued process performance and product quality. (ICH Q10)

          the PIC/S GMP Guide (see PE 009 (Part II)).



    PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -245-                              25 August 2023
                                          Annex 19     Reference and Retention Samples



ANNEX 19

           REFERENCE AND RETENTION SAMPLES


1.     SCOPE
1.1    This Annex to the Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products
       (“the GMP Guide”) gives guidance on the taking and holding of reference
       samples of starting materials, packaging materials or finished products and
       retention samples of finished products.

1.2    Specific requirements for investigational medicinal products are given in Annex
       13 to the Guide.

1.3    This annex also includes guidance on the taking of retention samples for parallel
       imported / distributed medicinal products.


2.     PRINCIPLE
2.1    Samples are retained to fulfil two purposes; firstly to provide a sample for
       analytical testing and secondly to provide a specimen of the fully finished product.
       Samples may therefore fall into two categories:

       Reference sample: a sample of a batch of starting material, packaging material
       or finished product which is stored for the purpose of being analyzed should the
       need arise during the shelf life of the batch concerned. Where stability permits,
       reference samples from critical intermediate stages (e.g. those requiring
       analytical testing and release) or intermediates that are transported outside of the
       manufacturer’s control should be kept.

       Retention sample: a sample of a fully packaged unit from a batch of finished
       product. It is stored for identification purposes. For example, presentation,
       packaging, labelling, patient information leaflet, batch number, expiry date should
       the need arise during the shelf life of the batch concerned. There may be
       exceptional circumstances where this requirement can be met without retention
       of duplicate samples e.g. where small amounts of a batch are packaged for
       different markets or in the production of very expensive medicinal products.

       For finished products, in many instances the reference and retention samples will
       be presented identically, i.e. as fully packaged units. In such circumstances,
       reference and retention samples may be regarded as interchangeable.

2.2    It is necessary for the manufacturer, importer or site of batch release, as specified
       under section 7 and 8, to keep reference and/or retention samples from each
       batch of finished product and, for the manufacturer to keep a reference sample
       from a batch of starting material (subject to certain exceptions – see 3.2 below)
       and/or intermediate product. Each packaging site should keep reference samples
       of each batch of primary and printed packaging materials. Availability of printed


 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -246-                           25 August 2023
                                          Annex 19     Reference and Retention Samples



       materials as part of the reference and/or retention sample of the finished product
       can be accepted.

2.3    The reference and/or retention samples serve as a record of the batch of finished
       product or starting material and can be assessed in the event of, for example, a
       dosage form quality complaint, a query relating to compliance with the marketing
       authorisation, a labelling/packaging query or a pharmacovigilance report.

2.4    Records of traceability of samples should be maintained and be available for
       review by competent authorities.


3.     DURATION OF STORAGE
3.1    Reference and retention samples from each batch of finished product should be
       retained for at least one year after the expiry date. The reference sample should
       be contained in its finished primary packaging or in packaging composed of the
       same material as the primary container in which the product is marketed (for
       veterinary medicinal products other than immunologicals, see also Annex 4,
       paragraphs 8 and 9).

3.2    Unless a longer period is required under the law of the country of manufacture
       (whose competent authority is a PIC/S Member), samples of starting materials
       (other than solvents, gases or water used in the manufacturing process) should
       be retained for at least two years after the release of product. That period may
       be shortened if the period of stability of the material, as indicated in the relevant
       specification, is shorter. Packaging materials should be retained for the duration
       of the shelf life of the finished product concerned.


4.     SIZE OF REFERENCE AND RETENTION SAMPLES
4.1    The reference sample should be of sufficient size to permit the carrying out, on,
       at least, two occasions, of the full analytical controls on the batch in accordance
       with the Marketing Authorisation File which has been assessed and approved by
       the relevant Competent Authority / Authorities. Where it is necessary to do so,
       unopened packs should be used when carrying out each set of analytical
       controls. Any proposed exception to this should be justified to, and agreed with,
       the relevant competent authority.

4.2    Where applicable, national requirements relating to the size of reference samples
       and, if necessary, retention samples, should be followed.

4.3    Reference samples should be representative of the batch of starting material,
       intermediate product or finished product from which they are taken. Other
       samples may also be taken to monitor the most stressed part of a process (e.g.
       beginning or end of a process). Where a batch is packaged in two, or more,
       distinct packaging operations, at least one retention sample should be taken from
       each individual packaging operation. Any proposed exception to this should be
       justified to, and agreed with, the relevant competent authority.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -247-                           25 August 2023
                                              Annex 19      Reference and Retention Samples



4.4    It should be ensured that all necessary analytical materials and equipment are
       still available, or are readily obtainable, in order to carry out all tests given in the
       specification until one year after expiry of the last batch manufactured.


5.     STORAGE CONDITIONS

5.1    […] *

5.2    Storage conditions should be in accordance with the marketing authorisation (e.g.
       refrigerated storage where relevant).


6.     WRITTEN AGREEMENTS
6.1    Where the marketing authorisation holder is not the same legal entity as the
       site(s) responsible for batch release, the responsibility for taking and storage of
       reference/retention samples should be defined in a written agreement between
       the two parties in accordance with Chapter 7 of the PIC/S Guide to Good
       Manufacturing Practice. This applies also where any manufacturing or batch
       release activity is carried out at a site other than that with overall responsibility for
       the batch and the arrangements between each different site for the taking and
       keeping of reference and retention samples should be defined in a written
       agreement.

6.2    The Authorised Person who certifies a batch for sale should ensure that all
       relevant reference and retention samples are accessible at all reasonable times.
       Where necessary, the arrangements for such access should be defined in a
       written agreement.

6.3    Where more than one site is involved in the manufacture of a finished product,
       the availability of written agreements is key to controlling the taking and location
       of reference and retention samples.


7.     REFERENCE SAMPLES – GENERAL POINTS
7.1    Reference samples are for the purpose of analysis and, therefore, should be
       conveniently available to a laboratory with validated methodology. For starting
       materials and packaging materials used for medicinal products, this is the original
       site of manufacture of the finished product. For finished products, this is the
       original site of manufacture.

7.2    […] *




*      This Section is specific to the EU GMP Guide and has not been adopted by PIC/S.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -248-                               25 August 2023
                                              Annex 19      Reference and Retention Samples



8.     RETENTION SAMPLES – GENERAL POINTS
8.1    A retention sample should represent a batch of finished products as distributed
       and may need to be examined in order to confirm non-technical attributes for
       compliance with the marketing authorisation or national legislation. The retention
       samples should preferably be stored at the site where the Authorised Person (AP)
       certifying the finished product batch is located.

8.2    […] *

8.3    Retention samples should be stored at the premises of an authorised
       manufacturer in order to permit ready access by the Competent Authority.

8.4    Where more than one manufacturing site is involved in the manufacture
       importation/packaging/testing/batch release, as appropriate of a product, the
       responsibility for taking and storage of retention samples should be defined in a
       written agreement(s) between the parties concerned.


9.     REFERENCE AND RETENTION SAMPLES FOR PARALLEL
       IMPORTED / PARALLEL DISTRIBUTED PRODUCTS
       Note: This section is only applicable if the national legislation deals with parallel
       imported / parallel distributed products.

9.1    Where the secondary packaging is not opened, only the packaging material used
       needs to be retained, as there is no, or little, risk of product mix up.

9.2    Where the secondary packaging is opened, for example, to replace the carton or
       patient information leaflet, then one retention sample, per packaging operation,
       containing the product should be taken, as there is a risk of product mix-up during
       the assembly process. It is important to be able to identify quickly who is
       responsible in the event of a mix-up (original manufacturer or parallel import
       assembler), as it would affect the extent of any resulting recall.


10.    REFERENCE AND RETENTION SAMPLES IN THE CASE
       OF CLOSEDOWN OF A MANUFACTURER
10.1   Where a manufacturer closes down and the manufacturing authorisation is
       surrendered, revoked, or ceases to exist, it is probable that many unexpired
       batches of medicinal products manufactured by that manufacturer remain on the
       market. In order for those batches to remain on the market, the manufacturer
       should make detailed arrangements for transfer of reference and retention
       samples (and relevant GMP documentation) to an authorised storage site. The
       manufacturer should satisfy the Competent Authority that the arrangements for
       storage are satisfactory and that the samples can, if necessary, be readily
       accessed and analysed.


*      This Section is specific to the EU GMP Guide and has not been adopted by PIC/S.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                          -249-                               25 August 2023
                                              Annex 19      Reference and Retention Samples



10.2   If the manufacturer is not in a position to make the necessary arrangements this
       may be delegated to another manufacturer. The Marketing Authorisation holder
       (MAH) is responsible for such delegation and for the provision of all necessary
       information to the Competent Authority. In addition, the MAH should, in relation
       to the suitability of the proposed arrangements for storage of reference and
       retention samples, consult with the competent authority of each country in which
       any unexpired batch has been placed on the market.

ANNEX 20*

                      QUALITY RISK MANAGEMENT


FOREWORD AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION
1.     The new GMP Annex 20 corresponds to ICH Q9 guideline on Quality Risk
       Management. It provides guidance on a systematic approach to quality risk
       management facilitating compliance with GMP and other quality requirements. It
       includes principles to be used and options for processes, methods and tools
       which may be used when applying a formal quality risk management approach.

2.     To ensure coherence, GMP Part I, Chapter 1 on Quality Management, has been
       revised to include aspects of quality risk management within the quality system
       framework. A similar revision is planned for Part II of the Guide. Other sections
       of the GMP Guide may be adjusted to include aspects of quality risk management
       in future broader revisions of those sections.

3.     With the revision of the chapters on quality management in GMP Parts I and II
       quality risk management becomes an integral part of a manufacturer’s quality
       system. Annex 20 itself is not intended, however, to create any new regulatory
       expectations; it provides an inventory of internationally acknowledged risk
       management methods and tools together with a list of potential applications at
       the discretion of manufacturers.

4.     It is understood that the ICH Q9 guideline was primarily developed for quality risk
       management of medicinal products for human use. With the implementation in
       Annex 20 benefits of the guideline, such as processes, methods and tools for
       quality risk management are also made available to the veterinary sector.

5.     While the GMP guide is primarily addressed to manufacturers, the ICH Q9
       guideline, has relevance for other quality guidelines and includes specific
       sections for regulatory agencies.

6.     However, for reasons of coherence and completeness, the ICH Q9 guideline has
       been transferred completely into GMP Annex 20.

INTRODUCTION
7.     Risk management principles are effectively utilized in many areas of business
       and government including finance, insurance, occupational safety, public health,
       pharmacovigilance, and by agencies regulating these industries. Although there
       are some examples of the use of quality risk management in the pharmaceutical
       industry today, they are limited and do not represent the full contributions that risk
       management has to offer. In addition, the importance of quality systems has been

 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -251-                            25 August 2023

       recognized in the pharmaceutical industry and it is becoming evident that quality
       risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality system.

8.     It is commonly understood that risk is defined as the combination of the probability
       of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. However, achieving a shared
       understanding of the application of risk management among diverse stakeholders
       is difficult because each stakeholder might perceive different potential harms,
       place a different probability on each harm occurring and attribute different
       severities to each harm. In relation to pharmaceuticals, although there are a
       variety of stakeholders, including patients and medical practitioners as well as
       government and industry, the protection of the patient by managing the risk to
       quality should be considered of prime importance.

9.     The manufacturing and use of a drug (medicinal) product, including its
       components, necessarily entail some degree of risk. The risk to its quality is just
       one component of the overall risk. It is important to understand that product
       quality should be maintained throughout the product lifecycle such that the
       attributes that are important to the quality of the drug (medicinal) product remain
       consistent with those used in the clinical studies. An effective quality risk
       management approach can further ensure the high quality of the drug (medicinal)
       product to the patient by providing a proactive means to identify and control
       potential quality issues during development and manufacturing. Additionally, use
       of quality risk management can improve the decision making if a quality problem
       arises. Effective quality risk management can facilitate better and more informed
       decisions, can provide regulators with greater assurance of a company’s ability
       to deal with potential risks and can beneficially affect the extent and level of direct
       regulatory oversight.

10.    The purpose of this document is to offer a systematic approach to quality risk
       management. It serves as a foundation or resource document that is independent
       of, yet supports, other ICH Quality documents and complements existing quality
       practices, requirements, standards, and guidelines within the pharmaceutical
       industry and regulatory environment. It specifically provides guidance on the
       principles and some of the tools of quality risk management that can enable more
       effective and consistent risk based decisions, both by regulators and industry,
       regarding the quality of drug substances and drug (medicinal) products across
       the product lifecycle. It is not intended to create any new expectations beyond
       the current regulatory requirements.

11.    It is neither always appropriate nor always necessary to use a formal risk
       management process (using recognized tools and/ or internal procedures e.g.
       standard operating procedures). The use of informal risk management processes
       (using empirical tools and/ or internal procedures) can also be considered
       acceptable.

12.    Appropriate use of quality risk management can facilitate but does not obviate
       industry’s obligation to comply with regulatory requirements and does not replace
       appropriate communications between industry and regulators.

SCOPE
13.    This guideline provides principles and examples of tools for quality risk
       management that can be applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality.
       These aspects include development, manufacturing, distribution, and the
       inspection and submission/review processes throughout the lifecycle of drug
       substances, drug (medicinal) products, biological and biotechnological products
       (including the use of raw materials, solvents, excipients, packaging and labeling
       materials in drug (medicinal) products, biological and biotechnological products).


PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY RISK MANAGEMENT
14.    Two primary principles of quality risk management are:
            The evaluation of the risk to quality should be based on scientific
             knowledge and ultimately link to the protection of the patient; and
            The level of effort, formality and documentation of the quality risk
             management process should be commensurate with the level of risk.


GENERAL QUALITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
15.    Quality risk management is a systematic process for the assessment, control,
       communication and review of risks to the quality of the drug (medicinal) product
       across the product lifecycle. A model for quality risk management is outlined in
       the diagram (Figure 1). Other models could be used. The emphasis on each
       component of the framework might differ from case to case but a robust process
       will incorporate consideration of all the elements at a level of detail that is
       commensurate with the specific risk.

16.    Decision nodes are not shown in the diagram above because decisions can occur
       at any point in the process. These decisions might be to return to the previous
       step and seek further information, to adjust the risk models or even to terminate
       the risk management process based upon information that supports such a
       decision. Note: “unacceptable” in the flowchart does not only refer to statutory,
       legislative or regulatory requirements, but also to the need to revisit the risk
       assessment process.

       Responsibilities

17.    Quality risk management activities are usually, but not always, undertaken by
       interdisciplinary teams. When teams are formed, they should include experts
       from the appropriate areas (e.g. quality unit, business development, engineering,
       regulatory affairs, production operations, sales and marketing, legal, statistics
       and clinical) in addition to individuals who are knowledgeable about the quality
       risk management process.

18.    Decision makers should:
            take responsibility for coordinating quality risk management across various
             functions and departments of their organization; and
            assure that a quality risk management process is defined, deployed and
             reviewed and that adequate resources are available.

       Initiating a Quality Risk Management Process

19.    Quality risk management should include systematic processes designed to
       coordinate, facilitate and improve science-based decision making with respect to
       risk. Possible steps used to initiate and plan a quality risk management process
       might include the following:
            Define the problem and/or risk question, including pertinent assumptions
             identifying the potential for risk
            Assemble background information and/ or data on the potential hazard,
             harm or human health impact relevant to the risk assessment
            Identify a leader and necessary resources
            Specify a timeline, deliverables and appropriate level of decision making
             for the risk management process

       Risk Assessment

20.    Risk assessment consists of the identification of hazards and the analysis and
       evaluation of risks associated with exposure to those hazards (as defined below).
       Quality risk assessments begin with a well-defined problem description or risk
       question. When the risk in question is well defined, an appropriate risk
       management tool (see examples in section 5) and the types of information
       needed to address the risk question will be more readily identifiable. As an aid to
       clearly defining the risk(s) for risk assessment purposes, three fundamental
       questions are often helpful:

         1. What might go wrong?
         2. What is the likelihood (probability) it will go wrong?
         3. What are the consequences (severity)?

       Risk identification is a systematic use of information to identify hazards referring
       to the risk question or problem description. Information can include historical
       data, theoretical analysis, informed opinions, and the concerns of stakeholders.
       Risk identification addresses the “What might go wrong?” question, including
       identifying the possible consequences. This provides the basis for further steps
       in the quality risk management process.

22.    Risk analysis is the estimation of the risk associated with the identified hazards.
       It is the qualitative or quantitative process of linking the likelihood of occurrence
       and severity of harms. In some risk management tools, the ability to detect the
       harm (detectability) also factors in the estimation of risk.

23.    Risk evaluation compares the identified and analyzed risk against given risk
       criteria. Risk evaluations consider the strength of evidence for all three of the
       fundamental questions.

24.    In doing an effective risk assessment, the robustness of the data set is important
       because it determines the quality of the output. Revealing assumptions and
       reasonable sources of uncertainty will enhance confidence in this output and/or
       help identify its limitations. Uncertainty is due to combination of incomplete
       knowledge about a process and its expected or unexpected variability. Typical



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -255-                           25 August 2023
                                                    Annex 20 Quality Risk Management



       sources of uncertainty include gaps in knowledge gaps in pharmaceutical science
       and process understanding, sources of harm (e.g., failure modes of a process,
       sources of variability), and probability of detection of problems.

25.    The output of a risk assessment is either a quantitative estimate of risk or a
       qualitative description of a range of risk. When risk is expressed quantitatively,
       a numerical probability is used. Alternatively, risk can be expressed using
       qualitative descriptors, such as “high”, “medium”, or “low”, which should be
       defined in as much detail as possible. Sometimes a "risk score" is used to further
       define descriptors in risk ranking. In quantitative risk assessments, a risk estimate
       provides the likelihood of a specific consequence, given a set of risk-generating
       circumstances. Thus, quantitative risk estimation is useful for one particular
       consequence at a time. Alternatively, some risk management tools use a relative
       risk measure to combine multiple levels of severity and probability into an overall
       estimate of relative risk. The intermediate steps within a scoring process can
       sometimes employ quantitative risk estimation.

       Risk Control

26.    Risk control includes decision making to reduce and/or accept risks. The purpose
       of risk control is to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The amount of effort
       used for risk control should be proportional to the significance of the risk. Decision
       makers might use different processes, including benefit-cost analysis, for
       understanding the optimal level of risk control.

27.    Risk control might focus on the following questions:
           Is the risk above an acceptable level?
           What can be done to reduce or eliminate risks?
           What is the appropriate balance among benefits, risks and resources?
           Are new risks introduced as a result of the identified risks being controlled?

28.    Risk reduction focuses on processes for mitigation or avoidance of quality risk
       when it exceeds a specified (acceptable) level (see Fig. 1). Risk reduction might
       include actions taken to mitigate the severity and probability of harm. Processes
       that improve the detectability of hazards and quality risks might also be used as
       part of a risk control strategy. The implementation of risk reduction measures can
       introduce new risks into the system or increase the significance of other existing
       risks. Hence, it might be appropriate to revisit the risk assessment to identify and
       evaluate any possible change in risk after implementing a risk reduction process.

29.    Risk acceptance is a decision to accept risk. Risk acceptance can be a formal
       decision to accept the residual risk or it can be a passive decision in which
       residual risks are not specified. For some types of harms, even the best quality
       risk management practices might not entirely eliminate risk. In these
       circumstances, it might be agreed that an appropriate quality risk management
       strategy has been applied and that quality risk is reduced to a specified
       (acceptable) level. This (specified) acceptable level will depend on many
       parameters and should be decided on a case-by-case basis.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -256-                            25 August 2023
                                                     Annex 20 Quality Risk Management



       Risk Communication

30.    Risk communication is the sharing of information about risk and risk
       management between the decision makers and others. Parties can communicate
       at any stage of the risk management process (see Fig. 1: dashed arrows). The
       output/result of the quality risk management process should be appropriately
       communicated and documented (see Fig. 1: solid arrows). Communications
       might include those among interested parties; e.g., regulators and industry,
       industry and the patient, within a company, industry or regulatory authority, etc.
       The included information might relate to the existence, nature, form, probability,
       severity, acceptability, control, treatment, detectability or other aspects of risks to
       quality. Communication need not be carried out for each and every risk
       acceptance. Between the industry and regulatory authorities, communication
       concerning quality risk management decisions might be effected through existing
       channels as specified in regulations and guidances.

       Risk Review

31.    Risk management should be an ongoing part of the quality management process.
       A mechanism to review or monitor events should be implemented.

32.    The output/results of the risk management process should be reviewed to take
       into account new knowledge and experience. Once a quality risk management
       process has been initiated, that process should continue to be utilized for events
       that might impact the original quality risk management decision, whether these
       events are planned (e.g. results of product review, inspections, audits, change
       control) or unplanned (e.g. root cause from failure investigations, recall). The
       frequency of any review should be based upon the level of risk. Risk review might
       include reconsideration of risk acceptance decisions (section 4.4).


RISK MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY
33.    Quality risk management supports a scientific and practical approach to decision-
       making. It provides documented, transparent and reproducible methods to
       accomplish steps of the quality risk management process based on current
       knowledge about assessing the probability, severity and sometimes detectability
       of the risk.

34.    Traditionally, risks to quality have been assessed and managed in a variety of
       informal ways (empirical and/ or internal procedures) based on, for example,
       compilation of observations, trends and other information. Such approaches
       continue to provide useful information that might support topics such as handling
       of complaints, quality defects, deviations and allocation of resources.

35.    Additionally, the pharmaceutical industry and regulators can assess and manage
       risk using recognized risk management tools and/ or internal procedures (e.g.,
       standard operating procedures). Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of these
       tools (further details in Annex 1 and Chapter 8):
             Basic risk management facilitation methods (flowcharts, check sheets etc.)
             Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -257-                             25 August 2023
                                                    Annex 20 Quality Risk Management



            Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)
            Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
            Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)
            Hazard Operability Analysis (HAZOP)
            Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)
            Risk ranking and filtering
            Supporting statistical tools

36.    It might be appropriate to adapt these tools for use in specific areas pertaining to
       drug substance and drug (medicinal) product quality. Quality risk management
       methods and the supporting statistical tools can be used in combination (e.g.
       Probabilistic Risk Assessment). Combined use provides flexibility that can
       facilitate the application of quality risk management principles.

37.    The degree of rigor and formality of quality risk management should reflect
       available knowledge and be commensurate with the complexity and/ or criticality
       of the issue to be addressed.


INTEGRATION OF QUALITY RISK MANAGEMENT                                               INTO
INDUSTRY AND REGULATORY OPERATIONS
38.    Quality risk management is a process that supports science-based and practical
       decisions when integrated into quality systems (see Annex II). As outlined in the
       introduction, appropriate use of quality risk management does not obviate
       industry’s obligation to comply with regulatory requirements. However, effective
       quality risk management can facilitate better and more informed decisions, can
       provide regulators with greater assurance of a company’s ability to deal with
       potential risks, and might affect the extent and level of direct regulatory oversight.
       In addition, quality risk management can facilitate better use of resources by all
       parties.

39.    Training of both industry and regulatory personnel in quality risk management
       processes provides for greater understanding of decision-making processes and
       builds confidence in quality risk management outcomes.

40.    Quality risk management should be integrated into existing operations and
       documented appropriately. Annex II provides examples of situations in which the
       use of the quality risk management process might provide information that could
       then be used in a variety of pharmaceutical operations. These examples are
       provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered a definitive
       or exhaustive list. These examples are not intended to create any new
       expectations beyond the requirements laid out in the current regulations.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -258-                            25 August 2023
                                                    Annex 20 Quality Risk Management



41.    Examples for industry and regulatory operations (see Annex II):
           Quality management

42.    Examples for industry operations and activities (see Annex II):
           Development
           Facility, equipment and utilities
           Materials management
           Production
           Laboratory control and stability testing
           Packaging and labelling

43.    Examples for regulatory operations (see Annex II):
           Inspection and assessment activities

44.    While regulatory decisions will continue to be taken on a regional basis, a
       common understanding and application of quality risk management principles
       could facilitate mutual confidence and promote more consistent decisions among
       regulators on the basis of the same information. This collaboration could be
       important in the development of policies and guidelines that integrate and support
       quality risk management practices.

APPENDIX I:            RISK MANAGEMENT METHODS AND TOOLS
       The purpose of this appendix is to provide a general overview of and references
       for some of the primary tools that might be used in quality risk management by
       industry and regulators. The references are included as an aid to gain more
       knowledge and detail about the particular tool. This is not an exhaustive list. It is
       important to note that no one tool or set of tools is applicable to every situation in
       which a quality risk management procedure is used.

I.1    Basic Risk Management Facilitation Methods

       Some of the simple techniques that are commonly used to structure risk
       management by organizing data and facilitating decision-making are:
             Flowcharts
             Check Sheets
             Process Mapping
             Cause and Effect Diagrams (also called an Ishikawa diagram or fish bone
              diagram)

I.2    Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)

       FMEA (see IEC 60812) provides for an evaluation of potential failure modes for
       processes and their likely effect on outcomes and/or product performance. Once
       failure modes are established, risk reduction can be used to eliminate, contain,
       reduce or control the potential failures. FMEA relies on product and process
       understanding. FMEA methodically breaks down the analysis of complex
       processes into manageable steps. It is a powerful tool for summarizing the
       important modes of failure, factors causing these failures and the likely effects of
       these failures.

       Potential Areas of Use(s)

       FMEA can be used to prioritize risks and monitor the effectiveness of risk control
       activities.

       FMEA can be applied to equipment and facilities and might be used to analyze a
       manufacturing operation and its effect on product or process. It identifies
       elements/operations within the system that render it vulnerable. The output/
       results of FMEA can be used as a basis for design or further analysis or to guide
       resource deployment.

I.3    Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)

       FMEA might be extended to incorporate an investigation of the degree of severity
       of the consequences, their respective probabilities of occurrence, and their
       detectability, thereby becoming a Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis
       (FMECA; see IEC 60812). In order for such an analysis to be performed, the
       product or process specifications should be established.

       FMECA can identify places where additional preventive actions might be
       appropriate to minimize risks.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -262-                            25 August 2023
                                                    Annex 20 Quality Risk Management




       Potential Areas of Use(s)

       FMECA application in the pharmaceutical industry should mostly be utilized for
       failures and risks associated with manufacturing processes; however, it is not
       limited to this application. The output of an FMECA is a relative risk “score” for
       each failure mode, which is used to rank the modes on a relative risk basis.

I.4    Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)

       The FTA tool (see IEC 61025) is an approach that assumes failure of the
       functionality of a product or process. This tool evaluates system (or subsystem)
       failures one at a time but can combine multiple causes of failure by identifying
       causal chains. The results are represented pictorially in the form of a tree of fault
       modes. At each level in the tree, combinations of fault modes are described with
       logical operators (AND, OR, etc.). FTA relies on the experts’ process
       understanding to identify causal factors.

       Potential Areas of Use(s)

       FTA can be used to establish the pathway to the root cause of the failure. FTA
       can be used to investigate complaints or deviations in order to fully understand
       their root cause and to ensure that intended improvements will fully resolve the
       issue and not lead to other issues (i.e. solve one problem yet cause a different
       problem). Fault Tree Analysis is an effective tool for evaluating how multiple
       factors affect a given issue. The output of an FTA includes a visual representation
       of failure modes. It is useful both for risk assessment and in developing
       monitoring programs.

I.5    Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)

       HACCP is a systematic, proactive, and preventive tool for assuring product
       quality, reliability, and safety (see WHO Technical Report Series No 908, 2003
       Annex 7). It is a structured approach that applies technical and scientific
       principles to analyze, evaluate, prevent, and control the risk or adverse
       consequence(s) of hazard(s) due to the design, development, production, and
       use of products.

       HACCP consists of the following seven steps:

         1. conduct a hazard analysis and identify preventive measures for each step
            of the process;
         2. determine the critical control points;
         3. establish critical limits;
         4. establish a system to monitor the critical control points;
         5. establish the corrective action to be taken when monitoring indicates that
            the critical control points are not in a state of control;
         6. establish system to verify that the HACCP system is working effectively;
         7. establish a record-keeping system.




 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                       -263-                           25 August 2023
                                                     Annex 20 Quality Risk Management



       Potential Areas of Use(s)

       HACCP might be used to identify and manage risks associated with physical,
       chemical and biological hazards (including microbiological contamination).
       HACCP is most useful when product and process understanding is sufficiently
       comprehensive to support identification of critical control points. The output of a
       HACCP analysis is risk management information that facilitates monitoring of
       critical points not only in the manufacturing process but also in other life cycle
       phases.

I.6    Hazard Operability Analysis (HAZOP)

       HAZOP (see IEC 61882) is based on a theory that assumes that risk events are
       caused by deviations from the design or operating intentions. It is a systematic
       brainstorming technique for identifying hazards using so-called “guide-words”.
       “Guide-words” (e.g., No, More, Other Than, Part of, etc.) are applied to relevant
       parameters (e.g., contamination, temperature) to help identify potential
       deviations from normal use or design intentions. It often uses a team of people
       with expertise covering the design of the process or product and its application.

       Potential Areas of Use(s)

       HAZOP can be applied to manufacturing processes, including outsourced
       production and formulation as well as the upstream suppliers, equipment and
       facilities for drug substances and drug (medicinal) products. It has also been used
       primarily in the pharmaceutical industry for evaluating process safety hazards. As
       is the case with HACCP, the output of a HAZOP analysis is a list of critical
       operations for risk management. This facilitates regular monitoring of critical
       points in the manufacturing process.

I.7    Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)

       PHA is a tool of analysis based on applying prior experience or knowledge of a
       hazard or failure to identify future hazards, hazardous situations and events that
       might cause harm, as well as to estimate their probability of occurrence for a
       given activity, facility, product or system. The tool consists of: 1) the identification
       of the possibilities that the risk event happens, 2) the qualitative evaluation of the
       extent of possible injury or damage to health that could result and 3) a relative
       ranking of the hazard using a combination of severity and likelihood of
       occurrence, and 4) the identification of possible remedial measures.

       Potential Areas of Use(s)

       PHA might be useful when analyzing existing systems or prioritizing hazards
       where circumstances prevent a more extensive technique from being used. It can
       be used for product, process and facility design as well as to evaluate the types
       of hazards for the general product type, then the product class, and finally the
       specific product. PHA is most commonly used early in the development of a
       project when there is little information on design details or operating procedures;
       thus, it will often be a precursor to further studies. Typically, hazards identified in
       the PHA are further assessed with other risk management tools such as those in
       this section.



 PE 009-17 (Annexes)                        -264-                            25 August 2023
                                                     Annex 20 Quality Risk Management




I.8    Risk Ranking and Filtering

       Risk ranking and filtering is a tool for comparing and ranking risks. Risk ranking
       of complex systems typically requires evaluation of multiple diverse quantitative
       and qualitative factors for each risk. The tool involves breaking down a basic risk
       question into as many components as needed to capture factors involved in the
       risk. These factors are combined into a single relative risk score that can then be
       used for ranking risks. “Filters,” in the form of weighting factors or cut-offs for risk
       scores, can be used to scale or fit the risk ranking to management or policy
       objectives.

       Potential Areas of Use(s)

       Risk ranking and filtering can be used to prioritize manufacturing sites for
       inspection/audit by regulators or industry. Risk ranking methods are particularly
       helpful in situations in which the portfolio of risks and the underlying
       consequences to be managed are diverse and difficult to compare using a single
       tool. Risk ranking is useful when management needs to evaluate both
       quantitatively-assessed and qualitatively-assessed risks within the same
       organizational framework.

I.9    Supporting Statistical Tools

       Statistical tools can support and facilitate quality risk management. They can
       enable effective data assessment, aid in determining the significance of the data
       set(s), and facilitate more reliable decision making. A listing of some of the
       principal statistical tools commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry is
       provided:

       (i) Control Charts, for example:
           -   Acceptance Control Charts (see ISO 7966)
           -   Control Charts with Arithmetic Average and Warning Limits (see ISO
               7873)

      Note: To complete certain stages of manufacture, it may be necessary to divide
            a batch into a number of subbatches, which are later brought together to
            form a final homogeneous batch. In the case of continuous manufacture,
            the batch must correspond to a defined fraction of the production,
            characterised by its intended homogeneity.

      For the control of the finished product, a batch of a medicinal products comprises
      all the units of a pharmaceutical form which are made from the same initial mass
      of material and have undergone a single series of manufacturing operations or a
      single sterilisation operation or, in the case of a continuous production process,
      all the units manufactured in a given period of time.

      Containment
      The action of confining a biological agent or other entity within a defined space.

      Primary containment: A system of containment which prevents the escape of a
      biological agent into the immediate working environment. It involves the use of
      closed containers or safety biological cabinets along with secure operating
      procedures.

      Secondary containment: A system of containment which prevents the escape of
      a biological agent into the external environment or into other working areas. It
      involves the use of rooms with specially designed air handling, the existence of
      airlocks and/or sterilises for the exit of materials and secure operating
      procedures. In many cases it may add to the effectiveness of primary
      containment.

      Contained area
      An area constructed and operated in such a manner (and equipped with
      appropriate air handling and filtration) so as to prevent contamination of the
      external environment by biological agents from within the area.

      Controlled area
      An area constructed and operated in such a manner that some attempt is made
      to control the introduction of potential contamination (an air supply approximating
      to grade D may be appropriate), and the consequences of accidental release of
      living organisms. The level of control exercised should reflect the nature of the
      organism employed in the process. At a minimum, the area should be maintained
      at a pressure negative to the immediate external environment and allow for the
      efficient removal of small quantities of airborne contaminants.
