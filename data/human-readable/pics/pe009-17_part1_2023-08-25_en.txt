CHAPTER 1

                 PHARMACEUTICAL QUALITY SYSTEM


PRINCIPLE
          The holder of a Manufacturing Authorisation must manufacture medicinal
          products so as to ensure that they are fit for their intended use, comply with the
          requirements of the Marketing Authorisation or Clinical Trial Authorisation, as
          appropriate, and do not place patients at risk due to inadequate safety, quality or
          efficacy. The attainment of this quality objective is the responsibility of senior
          management and requires the participation and commitment by staff in many
          different departments and at all levels within the company, by the company’s
          suppliers and by its distributors. To achieve this quality objective reliably there
          must be a comprehensively designed and correctly implemented Pharmaceutical
          Quality System incorporating Good Manufacturing Practice and Quality Risk
          Management. It should be fully documented and its effectiveness monitored. All
          parts of the Pharmaceutical Quality System should be adequately resourced with
          competent personnel, and suitable and sufficient premises, equipment and
          facilities. There are additional legal responsibilities for the holder of the
          Manufacturing Authorisation and for the Authorised Person(s).

          The basic concepts of Quality Management, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
          and Quality Risk Management are inter-related. They are described here in order
          to emphasise their relationships and their fundamental importance to the
          production and control of medicinal products.


PHARMACEUTICAL QUALITY SYSTEM 1
1.1       Quality Management is a wide-ranging concept, which covers all matters, which
          individually or collectively influence the quality of a product. It is the sum total of
          the organised arrangements made with the objective of ensuring that medicinal
          products are of the quality required for their intended use. Quality Management
          therefore incorporates Good Manufacturing Practice.

1.2       GMP applies to the lifecycle stages from the manufacture of investigational
          medicinal products, technology transfer, commercial manufacturing through to
          product discontinuation. However the Pharmaceutical Quality System can extend
          to the pharmaceutical development lifecycle stage as described in ICH Q10,
          which while optional, should facilitate innovation and continual improvement and
          strengthen the link between pharmaceutical development and manufacturing
          activities.


1         National requirements require manufacturers to establish and implement an effective
          pharmaceutical quality assurance system. The term Pharmaceutical Quality System is
          used in this chapter in the interests of consistency with ICH Q10 terminology. For the
          purposes of this chapter these terms can be considered interchangeable.


    PE 009-17 (Part I)                         -1-                              25 August 2023
                                              Chapter 1    Pharmaceutical Quality System




1.3    The size and complexity of the company’s activities should be taken into
       consideration when developing a new Pharmaceutical Quality System or
       modifying an existing one. The design of the system should incorporate
       appropriate risk management principles including the use of appropriate tools.
       While some aspects of the system can be company-wide and others site-specific,
       the effectiveness of the system is normally demonstrated at the site level.

1.4    A Pharmaceutical Quality System appropriate for the manufacture of medicinal
       products should ensure that:

       (i)     Product realisation is achieved by designing, planning, implementing,
               maintaining and continuously improving a system that allows the consistent
               delivery of products with appropriate quality attributes;

       (ii)    Product and process knowledge is managed throughout all lifecycle stages;

       (iii)   Medicinal products are designed and developed in a way that takes account
               of the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice;

       (iv)    Production and control operations are clearly specified and Good
               Manufacturing Practice adopted;

       (v)     Managerial responsibilities are clearly specified;

       (vi)    Arrangements are made for the manufacture, supply and use of the correct
               starting and packaging materials, the selection and monitoring of suppliers
               and for verifying that each delivery is from the approved supply chain;

       (vii) Processes are in place to assure the management of outsourced activities;

       (viii) A state of control is established and maintained by developing and using
              effective monitoring and control systems for process performance and
              product quality;

       (ix)    The results of product and processes monitoring are taken into account in
               batch release, in the investigation of deviations, and, with a view to taking
               preventive action to avoid potential deviations occurring in the future;

       (x)     All necessary controls on intermediate products, and any other in-process
               controls and validations are carried out;

       (xi)    Continual improvement is facilitated through the implementation of quality
               improvements appropriate to the current level of process and product
               knowledge;

       (xii) Arrangements are in place for the prospective evaluation of planned
             changes and their approval prior to implementation taking into account
             regulatory notification and approval where required;

       (xiii) After implementation of any change, an evaluation is undertaken to confirm
              the quality objectives were achieved and that there was no unintended
              deleterious impact on product quality;


 PE 009-17 (Part I)                         -2-                            25 August 2023
                                            Chapter 1     Pharmaceutical Quality System




       (xiv) An appropriate level of root cause analysis should be applied during the
             investigation of deviations, suspected product defects and other problems.

              This can be determined using Quality Risk Management principles. In
              cases where the true root cause(s) of the issue cannot be determined,
              consideration should be given to identifying the most likely root cause(s)
              and to addressing those. Where human error is suspected or identified as
              the cause, this should be justified having taken care to ensure that process,
              procedural or system based errors or problems have not been overlooked,
              if present. Appropriate corrective actions and/or preventive actions
              (CAPAs) should be identified and taken in response to investigations. The
              effectiveness of such actions should be monitored and assessed, in line
              with Quality Risk Management principles;

       (xv) Medicinal products are not sold or supplied before an Authorised Person
            has certified that each production batch has been produced and controlled
            in accordance with the requirements of the Marketing Authorisation and any
            other regulations relevant to the production, control and release of
            medicinal products;

       (xvi) Satisfactory arrangements exist to ensure, as far as possible, that the
             medicinal products are stored, distributed and subsequently handled so
             that quality is maintained throughout their shelf life;

       (xvii) There is a process for self-inspection and/or quality audit, which regularly
              appraises the effectiveness and applicability of the Pharmaceutical Quality
              System.

1.5    Senior management has the ultimate responsibility to ensure an effective
       Pharmaceutical Quality System is in place, adequately resourced and that roles,
       responsibilities, and authorities are defined, communicated and implemented
       throughout the organisation. Senior management’s leadership and active
       participation in the Pharmaceutical Quality System is essential. This leadership
       should ensure the support and commitment of staff at all levels and sites within
       the organisation to the Pharmaceutical Quality System.

1.6    There should be periodic management review, with the involvement of senior
       management, of the operation of the Pharmaceutical Quality System to identify
       opportunities for continual improvement of products, processes and the system
       itself.

1.7    The Pharmaceutical Quality System should be defined and documented. A
       Quality Manual or equivalent documentation should be established and should
       contain a description of the quality management system including management
       responsibilities.

GOOD MANUFACTURING                           PRACTICE            FOR        MEDICINAL
PRODUCTS
1.8    Good Manufacturing Practice is that part of Quality Management which ensures
       that products are consistently produced and controlled to the quality standards
       appropriate to their intended use and as required by the Marketing Authorisation,
       Clinical Trial Authorisation or product specification. Good Manufacturing Practice
       is concerned with both production and quality control. The basic requirements of
       GMP are that:

       (i)     All manufacturing processes are clearly defined, systematically reviewed in
               the light of experience and shown to be capable of consistently
               manufacturing medicinal products of the required quality and complying
               with their specifications;

       (ii)    Critical steps of manufacturing processes and significant changes to the
               process are validated;

       (iii)   All necessary facilities for GMP are provided including:

                Appropriately qualified and trained personnel;
                Adequate premises and space;
                Suitable equipment and services;
                Correct materials, containers and labels;
                Approved procedures and instructions, in accordance with the
                 Pharmaceutical Quality System;
                Suitable storage and transport.

       (iv)    Instructions and procedures are written in an instructional form in clear and
               unambiguous language, specifically applicable to the facilities provided;

       (v)     Procedures are carried out correctly and operators are trained to do so;

       (vi)    Records are made, manually and/or by recording instruments, during
               manufacture which demonstrate that all the steps required by the defined
               procedures and instructions were in fact taken and that the quantity and
               quality of the product was as expected;

       (vii) Any significant deviations are fully recorded, investigated with the objective
             of determining the root cause and appropriate corrective and preventive
             action implemented;

       (viii) Records of manufacture including distribution which enable the complete
              history of a batch to be traced are retained in a comprehensible and
              accessible form;

       (ix)    The distribution of the products minimises any risk to their quality and takes
               account of good distribution practice;

       (x)     A system is available to recall any batch of product, from sale or supply;




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                          -4-                            25 August 2023
                                             Chapter 1    Pharmaceutical Quality System



       (xi)    Complaints about products are examined, the causes of quality defects
               investigated and appropriate measures taken in respect of the defective
               products and to prevent reoccurrence.


QUALITY CONTROL
1.9    Quality Control is that part of Good Manufacturing Practice which is concerned
       with sampling, specifications and testing, and with the organisation,
       documentation and release procedures which ensure that the necessary and
       relevant tests are actually carried out and that materials are not released for use,
       nor products released for sale or supply, until their quality has been judged to be
       satisfactory. The basic requirements of Quality Control are that:

       (i)     Adequate facilities, trained personnel and approved procedures are
               available for sampling and testing starting materials, packaging materials,
               intermediate, bulk, and finished products, and where appropriate for
               monitoring environmental conditions for GMP purposes;

       (ii)    Samples of starting materials, packaging materials, intermediate products,
               bulk products and finished products are taken by approved personnel and
               methods;

       (iii)   Test methods are validated;

       (iv)    Records are made, manually and/or by recording instruments, which
               demonstrate that all the required sampling, inspecting and testing
               procedures were actually carried out. Any deviations are fully recorded and
               investigated;

       (v)     The finished products contain active ingredients complying with the
               qualitative and quantitative composition of the Marketing Authorisation or
               Clinical Trial Authorisation, are of the purity required, and are enclosed
               within their proper containers and correctly labelled;

       (vi)    Records are made of the results of inspection and that testing of materials,
               intermediate, bulk, and finished products is formally assessed against
               specification. Product assessment includes a review and evaluation of
               relevant production documentation and an assessment of deviations from
               specified procedures;

       (vii) No batch of product is released for sale or supply prior to certification by an
             Authorised Person that it is in accordance with the requirements of the
             relevant authorisations;

       (viii) Sufficient reference samples of starting materials and products are retained
              in accordance with Annex 19 to permit future examination of the product if
              necessary and that the sample is retained in the final pack.

PRODUCT QUALITY REVIEW
1.10   Regular periodic or rolling quality reviews of all authorised medicinal products,
       including export only products, should be conducted with the objective of verifying
       the consistency of the existing process, the appropriateness of current
       specifications for both starting materials and finished product, to highlight any
       trends and to identify product and process improvements. Such reviews should
       normally be conducted and documented annually, taking into account previous
       reviews, and should include at least:

       (i)     A review of starting materials including packaging materials used in the
               product, especially those from new sources and in particular the review of
               supply chain traceability of active substances;

       (ii)    A review of critical in-process controls and finished product results;

       (iii)   A review of all batches that failed to meet established specification(s) and
               their investigation;

       (iv)    A review of all significant deviations or non-conformances, their related
               investigations, and the effectiveness of resultant corrective and preventive
               actions taken;

       (v)     A review of all changes carried out to the processes or analytical methods;

       (vi)    A review of Marketing Authorisation variations submitted, granted or
               refused, including those for third country (export only) dossiers;

       (vii) A review of the results of the stability monitoring programme and any
             adverse trends;

       (viii) A review of all quality-related returns, complaints and recalls and the
              investigations performed at the time;

       (ix)    A review of adequacy of any other previous product process or equipment
               corrective actions;

       (x)     For new Marketing Authorisations and variations               to   Marketing
               Authorisations, a review of post-marketing commitments;

       (xi)    The qualification status of relevant equipment and utilities, e.g. HVAC,
               water, compressed gases, etc;

       (xii) A review of any contractual arrangements as defined in Chapter 7 to ensure
             that they are up to date.

1.11   The manufacturer and, where different, Marketing Authorisation holder should
       evaluate the results of the review and an assessment made as to whether
       corrective and preventive action or any revalidation should be undertaken, under
       the Pharmaceutical Quality System. There should be management procedures
       for the ongoing management and review of these actions and the effectiveness
       of these procedures verified during self-inspection. Quality reviews may be

       grouped by product type, e.g. solid dosage forms, liquid dosage forms, sterile
       products, etc. where scientifically justified.

       Where the Marketing Authorisation holder is not the manufacturer, there should
       be a technical agreement in place between the various parties that defines their
       respective responsibilities in producing the product quality review. The Authorised
       Person responsible for final batch certification together with the Marketing
       Authorisation holder should ensure that the quality review is performed in a timely
       manner and is accurate.


QUALITY RISK MANAGEMENT
1.12   Quality Risk Management is a systematic process for the assessment, control,
       communication and review of risks to the quality of the medicinal product. It can
       be applied both proactively and retrospectively.

1.13   The principles of Quality Risk Management are that:

       (i)    The evaluation of the risk to quality is based on scientific knowledge,
              experience with the process and ultimately links to the protection of the
              patient;

       (ii)   The level of effort, formality and documentation of the Quality Risk
              Management process is commensurate with the level of risk.

       Examples of the processes and applications of Quality Risk Management can be
       found inter alia in Annex 20 or ICHQ9.

                                                                  Chapter 2     Personnel



CHAPTER 2

                                  PERSONNEL

PRINCIPLE
       The correct manufacture of medicinal products relies upon people. For this
       reason there must be sufficient qualified personnel to carry out all the tasks which
       are the responsibility of the manufacturer. Individual responsibilities should be
       clearly understood by the individuals and recorded. All personnel should be
       aware of the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice that affect them and
       receive initial and continuing training, including hygiene instructions, relevant to
       their needs.


GENERAL
2.1    The manufacturer should have an adequate number of personnel with the
       necessary qualifications and practical experience. Senior management should
       determine and provide adequate and appropriate resources (human, financial,
       materials, facilities and equipment) to implement and maintain the
       Pharmaceutical Quality System and continually improve its effectiveness. The
       responsibilities placed on any one individual should not be so extensive as to
       present any risk to quality.

2.2    The manufacturer must have an organisation chart in which the relationships
       between the heads of Production, Quality Control and where applicable Head of
       Quality Assurance or Quality Unit referred to in point 2.5 and the position of the
       Authorised Person(s) are clearly shown in the managerial hierarchy.

2.3    People in responsible positions should have specific duties recorded in written
       job descriptions and adequate authority to carry out their responsibilities. Their
       duties may be delegated to designated deputies of a satisfactory qualification
       level. There should be no gaps or unexplained overlaps in the responsibilities of
       those personnel concerned with the application of Good Manufacturing Practice.

2.4    Senior management has the ultimate responsibility to ensure an effective
       Pharmaceutical Quality System is in place to achieve the quality objectives, and,
       that roles, responsibilities, and authorities are defined, communicated and
       implemented throughout the organisation. Senior management should establish
       a quality policy that describes the overall intentions and direction of the company
       related to quality and should ensure continuing suitability and effectiveness of the
       Pharmaceutical Quality System and GMP compliance through participation in
       management review.




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        -8-                            25 August 2023
                                                                   Chapter 2     Personnel



KEY PERSONNEL
2.5    Senior Management should appoint Key Management Personnel including the
       head of Production, the head of Quality Control, and if at least one of these
       persons is not responsible for the release of products the Authorised Person(s)
       designated for the purpose. Normally, key posts should be occupied by full-time
       personnel. The heads of Production and Quality Control must be independent
       from each other. In large organisations, it may be necessary to delegate some of
       the functions listed in 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9. Additionally, depending on the size and
       organisational structure of the company, a separate Head of Quality Assurance
       or Head of the Quality Unit may be appointed. Where such a function exists
       usually some of the responsibilities described in 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9 are shared with
       the Head of Quality Control and Head of Production and senior management
       should therefore take care that roles, responsibilities, and authorities are defined.

2.6    The duties of the Authorised Person(s) are described in the national requirements
       and can be summarised as follows:

       a)      An Authorised Person must ensure that each batch of medicinal products
               has been manufactured and checked in compliance with the laws in force
               in that country and in accordance with the requirements of the Marketing
               Authorisation;

       b)      The Authorised Person(s) must meet the qualification requirements laid
               down in the national legislation, they shall be permanently and continuously
               at the disposal of the holder of the Manufacturing Authorisation to carry out
               their responsibilities;

       c)      The responsibilities of an Authorised Person may be delegated, but only to
               other Authorised Person(s).

2.7    The head of Production generally has the following responsibilities:

       (i)     To ensure that products are produced and stored according to the
               appropriate documentation in order to obtain the required quality;

       (ii)    To approve the instructions relating to production operations and to ensure
               their strict implementation;

       (iii)   To ensure that the production records are evaluated and signed by an
               authorised person;

       (iv)    To ensure the qualification and maintenance of his department, premises
               and equipment;

       (v)     To ensure that the appropriate validations are done;

       (vi)    To ensure that the required initial and continuing training of his department
               personnel is carried out and adapted according to need.




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                         -9-                            25 August 2023
                                                                  Chapter 2    Personnel



2.8    The head of Quality Control generally has the following responsibilities:

       (i)     To approve or reject, as he/she sees fit, starting materials, packaging
               materials, intermediate, bulk and finished products;

       (ii)    To ensure that all necessary testing is carried out and the associated
               records evaluated;

       (iii)   To approve specifications, sampling instructions, test methods and other
               Quality Control procedures;

       (iv)    To approve and monitor any contract analysts;

       (v)     To ensure the qualification and maintenance of his/her department,
               premises and equipment;

       (vi)    To ensure that the appropriate validations are done;

       (vii) To ensure that the required initial and continuing training of his department
             personnel is carried out and adapted according to need.

       Other duties of Quality Control are summarised in Chapter 6.

2.9    The heads of Production, Quality Control and where relevant, Head of Quality
       Assurance or Head of Quality Unit, generally have some shared, or jointly
       exercised, responsibilities relating to quality including in particular the design,
       effective implementation, monitoring and maintenance of the Pharmaceutical
       Quality System. These may include, subject to any national regulations:

       (i)     The authorisation of written procedures and other documents, including
               amendments;

       (ii)    The monitoring and control of the manufacturing environment;

       (iii)   Plant hygiene;

       (iv)    Process validation;

       (v)     Training;

       (vi)    The approval and monitoring of suppliers of materials;

       (vii) The approval and monitoring of contract manufacturers and providers of
             other GMP related outsourced activities;

       (viii) The designation and monitoring of storage conditions for materials and
              products;

       (ix)    The retention of records;

       (x)     The monitoring of compliance with the requirements of Good Manufacturing
               Practice;



 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 10 -                        25 August 2023
                                                                 Chapter 2    Personnel



       (xi)   The inspection, investigation, and taking of samples, in order to monitor
              factors which may affect product quality;

       (xii) Participation in management reviews of process performance, product
             quality and of the Pharmaceutical Quality System and advocating continual
             improvement;

       (xiii) Ensuring that a timely and effective communication and escalation process
              exists to raise quality issues to the appropriate levels of management.


TRAINING
2.10   The manufacturer should provide training for all the personnel whose duties take
       them into production and storage areas or into control laboratories (including the
       technical, maintenance and cleaning personnel), and for other personnel whose
       activities could affect the quality of the product.

2.11   Besides the basic training on the theory and practice of the Pharmaceutical
       Quality System and Good Manufacturing Practice, newly recruited personnel
       should receive training appropriate to the duties assigned to them. Continuing
       training should also be given, and its practical effectiveness should be
       periodically assessed. Training programmes should be available, approved by
       either the head of Production or the head of Quality Control, as appropriate.
       Training records should be kept.

2.12   Personnel working in areas where contamination is a hazard, e.g. clean areas or
       areas where highly active, toxic, infectious or sensitising materials are handled,
       should be given specific training.

2.13   Visitors or untrained personnel should, preferably, not be taken into the
       production and quality control areas. If this is unavoidable, they should be given
       information in advance, particularly about personal hygiene and the prescribed
       protective clothing. They should be closely supervised.

2.14   The Pharmaceutical Quality System and all the measures capable of improving
       its understanding and implementation should be fully discussed during the
       training sessions.


PERSONNEL HYGIENE
2.15   Detailed hygiene programmes should be established and adapted to the different
       needs within the factory. They should include procedures relating to the health,
       hygiene practices and clothing of personnel. These procedures should be
       understood and followed in a very strict way by every person whose duties take
       him into the production and control areas. Hygiene programmes should be
       promoted by management and widely discussed during training sessions.

2.16   All personnel should receive medical examination upon recruitment. It must be
       the manufacturer’s responsibility that there are instructions ensuring that health
       conditions that can be of relevance to the quality of products come to the


 PE 009-17 (Part I)                      - 11 -                          25 August 2023
                                                                 Chapter 2    Personnel



       manufacturer’s knowledge. After the first medical examination, examinations
       should be carried out when necessary for the work and personal health.

2.17   Steps should be taken to ensure as far as is practicable that no person affected
       by an infectious disease or having open lesions on the exposed surface of the
       body is engaged in the manufacture of medicinal products.

2.18   Every person entering the manufacturing areas should wear protective garments
       appropriate to the operations to be carried out.

2.19   Eating, drinking, chewing or smoking, or the storage of food, drink, smoking
       materials or personal medication in the production and storage areas should be
       prohibited. In general, any unhygienic practice within the manufacturing areas or
       in any other area where the product might be adversely affected should be
       forbidden.

2.20   Direct contact should be avoided between the operator’s hands and the exposed
       product as well as with any part of the equipment that comes into contact with the
       products.

2.21   Personnel should be instructed to use the hand-washing facilities.

2.22   Any specific requirements for the manufacture of special groups of products, for
       example sterile preparations, are covered in the annexes.


CONSULTANTS
2.23   Consultants should have adequate education, training, and experience, or any
       combination thereof, to advise on the subject for which they are retained.

       Records should be maintained stating the name, address, qualifications, and type
       of service provided by these consultants.

CHAPTER 3

                      PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT


PRINCIPLE
       Premises and equipment must be located, designed, constructed, adapted and
       maintained to suit the operations to be carried out. Their layout and design must
       aim to minimise the risk of errors and permit effective cleaning and maintenance
       in order to avoid cross-contamination, build-up of dust or dirt and, in general, any
       adverse effect on the quality of products.


PREMISES
       General

3.1.   Premises should be situated in an environment which, when considered together
       with measures to protect the manufacture, presents minimal risk of causing
       contamination of materials or products.

3.2.   Premises should be carefully maintained, ensuring that repair and maintenance
       operations do not present any hazard to the quality of products. They should be
       cleaned and, where applicable, disinfected according to detailed written
       procedures.

3.3.   Lighting, temperature, humidity and ventilation should be appropriate and such
       that they do not adversely affect, directly or indirectly, either the medicinal
       products during their manufacture and storage, or the accurate functioning of
       equipment.

3.4.   Premises should be designed and equipped so as to afford maximum protection
       against the entry of insects or other animals.

3.5.   Steps should be taken in order to prevent the entry of unauthorised people.
       Production, storage and quality control areas should not be used as a right of
       way by personnel who do not work in them.

       Production Areas

3.6    Cross-contamination should be prevented for all products by appropriate design
       and operation of manufacturing facilities. The measures to prevent cross-
       contamination should be commensurate with the risks. Quality Risk Management
       principles should be used to assess and control the risks.

       Depending of the level of risk, it may be necessary to dedicate premises and
       equipment for manufacturing and/or packaging operations to control the risk
       presented by some medicinal products.



 PE 009-17 (Part I)                       - 13 -                          25 August 2023
                                                    Chapter 3    Premises and equipment



       Dedicated facilities are required for manufacturing when a medicinal product
       presents a risk because:

       i.    the risk cannot be adequately controlled by operational and/ or technical
             measures,

       ii.   scientific data from the toxicological evaluation does not support a
             controllable risk (e.g. allergenic potential from highly sensitising materials
             such as beta-lactams) or

       iii. relevant residue limits, derived from the toxicological evaluation, cannot be
            satisfactorily determined by a validated analytical method.

       Further guidance can be found in Chapter 5 and in Annexes 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6.

3.7.   Premises should preferably be laid out in such a way as to allow the production
       to take place in areas connected in a logical order corresponding to the sequence
       of the operations and to the requisite cleanliness levels.

3.8.   The adequacy of the working and in-process storage space should permit the
       orderly and logical positioning of equipment and materials so as to minimise the
       risk of confusion between different medicinal products or their components, to
       avoid cross-contamination and to minimise the risk of omission or wrong
       application of any of the manufacturing or control steps.

3.9.   Where starting and primary packaging materials, intermediate or bulk products
       are exposed to the environment, interior surfaces (walls, floors and ceilings)
       should be smooth, free from cracks and open joints, and should not shed
       particulate matter and should permit easy and effective cleaning and, if
       necessary, disinfection.

3.10   Pipework, light fittings, ventilation points and other services should be designed
       and sited to avoid the creation of recesses which are difficult to clean. As far as
       possible, for maintenance purposes, they should be accessible from outside the
       manufacturing areas.

3.11. Drains should be of adequate size, and have trapped gullies. Open channels
      should be avoided where possible, but if necessary, they should be shallow to
      facilitate cleaning and disinfection.

3.12. Production areas should be effectively ventilated, with air control facilities
      (including temperature and, where necessary, humidity and filtration) appropriate
      both to the products handled, to the operations undertaken within them and to the
      external environment.

3.13   Weighing of starting materials usually should be carried out in a separate
       weighing room designed for such use.

3.14. In cases where dust is generated (e.g. during sampling, weighing, mixing and
      processing operations, packaging of dry products), specific provisions should be
      taken to avoid cross-contamination and facilitate cleaning.




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 14 -                          25 August 2023
                                                    Chapter 3    Premises and equipment



3.15. Premises for the packaging of medicinal products should be specifically designed
      and laid out so as to avoid mix-ups or cross-contamination.

3.16   Production areas should be well lit, particularly where visual on-line controls are
       carried out.

3.17. In-process controls may be carried out within the production area provided they
      do not carry any risk to production.

       Storage Areas

3.18. Storage areas should be of sufficient capacity to allow orderly storage of the
      various categories of materials and products: starting and packaging materials,
      intermediate, bulk and finished products, products in quarantine, released,
      rejected, returned or recalled.

3.19. Storage areas should be designed or adapted to ensure good storage conditions.
      In particular, they should be clean and dry and maintained within acceptable
      temperature limits. Where special storage conditions are required (e.g.
      temperature, humidity) these should be provided, checked and monitored.
3.20 Receiving and dispatch bays should protect materials and products from the
      weather. Reception areas should be designed and equipped to allow containers
      of incoming materials to be cleaned where necessary before storage.

3.21. Where quarantine status is ensured by storage in separate areas, these areas
      must be clearly marked and their access restricted to authorised personnel. Any
      system replacing the physical quarantine should give equivalent security.

3.22. There should normally be a separate sampling area for starting materials. If
      sampling is performed in the storage area, it should be conducted in such a way
      as to prevent contamination or cross-contamination.

3.23. Segregated areas should be provided for the storage of rejected, recalled or
      returned materials or products.

3.24. Highly active materials or products should be stored in safe and secure areas.

3.25. Printed packaging materials are considered critical to the conformity of the
      medicinal product and special attention should be paid to the safe and secure
      storage of these materials.

       Quality Control Areas

3.26. Normally, Quality Control laboratories should be separated from production
      areas. This is particularly important for laboratories for the control of biologicals,
      microbiologicals and radioisotopes, which should also be separated from each
      other.

3.27. Control laboratories should be designed to suit the operations to be carried out in
      them.     Sufficient space should be given to avoid mix-ups and cross-
      contamination. There should be adequate suitable storage space for samples
      and records.



 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 15 -                          25 August 2023
                                                   Chapter 3    Premises and equipment



3.28. Separate rooms may be necessary to protect sensitive instruments from
      vibration, electrical interference, humidity, etc.

3.29. Special requirements are needed in laboratories handling particular substances,
      such as biological or radioactive samples.

       Ancillary Areas

3.30. Rest and refreshment rooms should be separate from other areas.

3.31. Facilities for changing clothes and for washing and toilet purposes should be
      easily accessible and appropriate for the number of users. Toilets should not
      directly communicate with production or storage areas.

3.32. Maintenance workshops should as far as possible be separated from production
      areas. Whenever parts and tools are stored in the production area, they should
      be kept in rooms or lockers reserved for that use.

3.33. Animal houses should be well isolated from other areas, with separate entrance
      (animal access) and air handling facilities.


EQUIPMENT
3.34. Manufacturing equipment should be designed, located and maintained to suit its
      intended purpose.
3.35. Repair and maintenance operations should not present any hazard to the quality
      of the products.
3.36. Manufacturing equipment should be designed so that it can be easily and
      thoroughly cleaned. It should be cleaned according to detailed and written
      procedures and stored only in a clean and dry condition.
3.37. Washing and cleaning equipment should be chosen and used in order not to be
      a source of contamination.
3.38. Equipment should be installed in such a way as to prevent any risk of error or of
      contamination.
3.39. Production equipment should not present any hazard to products. Parts of
      production equipment that come into contact with the product must not be
      reactive, additive or absorptive to such an extent that it will affect the quality of

CHAPTER 4

                             DOCUMENTATION


PRINCIPLE
      Good documentation constitutes an essential part of the quality assurance
      system and is key to operating in compliance with GMP requirements. The
      various types of documents and media used should be fully defined in the
      manufacturer's Quality Management System. Documentation may exist in a
      variety of forms, including paper-based, electronic or photographic media. The
      main objective of the system of documentation utilised must be to establish,
      control, monitor and record all activities which directly or indirectly impact on all
      aspects of the quality of medicinal products. The Quality Management System
      should include sufficient instructional detail to facilitate a common understanding
      of the requirements, in addition to providing for sufficient recording of the various
      processes and evaluation of any observations, so that ongoing application of the
      requirements may be demonstrated.

      There are two primary types of documentation used to manage and record GMP
      compliance: instructions (directions, requirements) and records/reports.
      Appropriate good documentation practice should be applied with respect to the
      type of document.

      Suitable controls should be implemented to ensure the accuracy, integrity,
      availability and legibility of documents. Instruction documents should be free from
      errors and available in writing. The term ‘written’ means recorded, or documented
      on media from which data may be rendered in a human readable form.


REQUIRED GMP DOCUMENTATION (BY TYPE)
      Site Master File: A document describing the GMP related activities of the
      manufacturer.

      Instructions (directions, or requirements) type:

      Specifications: Describe in detail the requirements with which the products or
      materials used or obtained during manufacture have to conform. They serve as
      a basis for quality evaluation.

      Manufacturing Formulae, Processing, Packaging and Testing Instructions:
      Provide detail all the starting materials, equipment and computerised systems (if
      any) to be used and specify all processing, packaging, sampling and testing
      instructions. In-process controls and process analytical technologies to be
      employed should be specified where relevant, together with acceptance criteria.

      Procedures: (Otherwise known as Standard Operating Procedures, or SOPs),
      give directions for performing certain operations.


PE 009-17 (Part I)                       - 18 -                           25 August 2023
                                                                    Chapter 4       Documentation




          Protocols: Give instructions for performing and recording certain discreet
          operations.

          Technical Agreements: Are agreed between contract givers and acceptors for
          outsourced activities.

          Record/Report type:

          Records: Provide evidence of various actions taken to demonstrate compliance
          with instructions, e.g. activities, events, investigations, and in the case of
          manufactured batches a history of each batch of product, including its distribution.
          Records include the raw data which is used to generate other records. For
          electronic records regulated users should define which data are to be used as
          raw data. At least, all data on which quality decisions are based should be defined
          as raw data.

          Certificates of Analysis: Provide a summary of testing results on samples of
          products or materials2 together with the evaluation for compliance to a stated
          specification.

          Reports: Document the conduct of particular exercises, projects or
          investigations, together with results, conclusions and recommendations.


GENERATION AND CONTROL OF DOCUMENTATION
4.1       All types of document should be defined and adhered to. The requirements apply
          equally to all forms of document media types. Complex systems need to be
          understood, well documented, validated, and adequate controls should be in
          place. Many documents (instructions and/or records) may exist in hybrid forms,
          i.e. some elements as electronic and others as paper based. Relationships and
          control measures for master documents, official copies, data handling and
          records need to be stated for both hybrid and homogenous systems. Appropriate
          controls for electronic documents such as templates, forms, and master
          documents should be implemented. Appropriate controls should be in place to
          ensure the integrity of the record throughout the retention period.

4.2       Documents should be designed, prepared, reviewed, and distributed with care.
          They should comply with the relevant parts of Product Specification Files,
          Manufacturing and Marketing Authorisation dossiers, as appropriate. The
          reproduction of working documents from master documents should not allow any
          error to be introduced through the reproduction process.

4.3       Documents containing instructions should be approved, signed and dated by
          appropriate and authorised persons. Documents should have unambiguous
          contents and be uniquely identifiable. The effective date should be defined.


2         Alternatively the certification may be based, in-whole or in-part, on the assessment of real
          time data (summaries and exception reports) from batch related process analytical
          technology (PAT), parameters or metrics as per the approved Marketing Authorisation
          dossier.


    PE 009-17 (Part I)                          - 19 -                              25 August 2023
                                                           Chapter 4       Documentation




4.4    Documents containing instructions should be laid out in an orderly fashion and
       be easy to check. The style and language of documents should fit with their
       intended use. Standard Operating Procedures, Work Instructions and Methods
       should be written in an imperative mandatory style.

4.5    Documents within the Quality Management System should be regularly reviewed
       and kept up-to-date. When a document has been revised, systems should be
       operated to prevent inadvertent use of superseded documents.

4.6    Documents should not be hand-written; although, where documents require the
       entry of data, sufficient space should be provided for such entries.


GOOD DOCUMENTATION PRACTICES
4.7    Handwritten entries should be made in clear, legible, indelible way.

4.8    Records should be made or completed at the time each action is taken and in
       such a way that all significant activities concerning the manufacture of medicinal
       products are traceable.

4.9    Any alteration made to the entry on a document should be signed and dated; the
       alteration should permit the reading of the original information. Where
       appropriate, the reason for the alteration should be recorded.


RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS
4.10   It should be clearly defined which record is related to each manufacturing activity
       and where this record is located. Secure controls must be in place to ensure the
       integrity of the record throughout the retention period and validated where
       appropriate.

4.11   Specific requirements apply to batch documentation which must be kept for one
       year after expiry of the batch to which it relates or at least five years after
       certification of the batch by the Authorised Person, whichever is the longer. For
       investigational medicinal products, the batch documentation must be kept for at
       least five years after the completion or formal discontinuation of the last clinical
       trial in which the batch was used. Other requirements for retention of
       documentation may be described in legislation in relation to specific types of
       product (e.g. Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products) and specify that longer
       retention periods be applied to certain documents.

4.12   For other types of documentation, the retention period will depend on the
       business activity which the documentation supports. Critical documentation,
       including raw data (for example relating to validation or stability), which supports
       information in the Marketing Authorisation should be retained whilst the
       authorisation remains in force. It may be considered acceptable to retire certain
       documentation (e.g. raw data supporting validation reports or stability reports)
       where the data has been superseded by a full set of new data. Justification for
       this should be documented and should take into account the requirements for


 PE 009-17 (Part I)                       - 20 -                          25 August 2023
                                                          Chapter 4      Documentation



       retention of batch documentation; for example, in the case of process validation
       data, the accompanying raw data should be retained for a period at least as long
       as the records for all batches whose release has been supported on the basis of
       that validation exercise.

       The following section gives some examples of required documents. The quality
       management system should describe all documents required to ensure product
       quality and patient safety.

CHAPTER 5

                                PRODUCTION


PRINCIPLE
       Production operations must follow clearly defined procedures; they must comply
       with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice in order to obtain products of
       the requisite quality and be in accordance with the relevant manufacturing and
       marketing authorisations.


GENERAL
5.1.   Production should be performed and supervised by competent people.

5.2.   All handling of materials and products, such as receipt and quarantine, sampling,
       storage, labelling, dispensing, processing, packaging and distribution should be
       done in accordance with written procedures or instructions and, where necessary,
       recorded.

5.3.   All incoming materials should be checked to ensure that the consignment
       corresponds to the order. Containers should be cleaned where necessary and
       labelled with the prescribed information.

5.4.   Damage to containers and any other problem which might adversely affect the
       quality of a material should be investigated, recorded and reported to the Quality
       Control Department.

5.5.   Incoming materials and finished products should be physically or administratively
       quarantined immediately after receipt or processing, until they have been
       released for use or distribution.

5.6.   Intermediate and bulk products purchased as such should be handled on receipt
       as though they were starting materials.

5.7.   All materials and products should be stored under the appropriate conditions
       established by the manufacturer and in an orderly fashion to permit batch
       segregation and stock rotation.

5.8.   Checks on yields, and reconciliation of quantities, should be carried out as
       necessary to ensure that there are no discrepancies outside acceptable limits.

5.9.   Operations on different products should not be carried out simultaneously or
       consecutively in the same room unless there is no risk of mix-up or cross-
       contamination.

5.10. At every stage of processing, materials and products should be protected from
      microbial and other contamination.



 PE 009-17 (Part I)                      - 27 -                          25 August 2023

5.11. When working with dry materials and products, special precautions should be
      taken to prevent the generation and dissemination of dust. This applies
      particularly to the handling of highly hazardous, including highly sensitising
      materials.

5.12. At all times during processing, all materials, bulk containers, major items of
      equipment and where appropriate rooms used should be labelled or otherwise
      identified with an indication of the product or material being processed, its
      strength (where applicable) and batch number. Where applicable, this indication
      should also mention the stage of production.

5.13. Labels applied to containers, equipment or premises should be clear,
      unambiguous and in the company’s agreed format. It is often helpful in addition
      to the wording on the labels to use colours to indicate status (for example,
      quarantined, accepted, rejected, clean).

5.14. Checks should be carried out to ensure that pipelines and other pieces of
      equipment used for the transportation of materials and products from one area to
      another are connected in a correct manner.

5.15. Any deviation from instructions or procedures should be avoided as far as
      possible. If a deviation occurs, it should be approved in writing by a competent
      person, with the involvement of the Quality Control department when appropriate.

5.16. Access to production premises should be restricted to authorised personnel.


PREVENTION OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION IN PRODUCTION
5.17. Normally, the production of non-medicinal products should be avoided in areas
      and with equipment destined for the production of medicinal products but, where
      justified, could be allowed where the measures to prevent cross-contamination
      with medicinal products described below and in Chapter 3 can be applied. The
      production and/or storage of technical poisons, such as pesticides (except where
      these are used for manufacture of medicinal products) and herbicides, should not
      be allowed in areas used for the manufacture and / or storage of medicinal
      products.

5.18. Contamination of a starting material or of a product by another material or product
      should be prevented. This risk of accidental cross-contamination resulting from
      the uncontrolled release of dust, gases, vapours, aerosols, genetic material or
      organisms from active substances, other materials (starting or in-process), and
      products in process, from residues on equipment, and from operators’ clothing
      should be assessed. The significance of this risk varies with the nature of the
      contaminant and that of the product being contaminated. Products in which cross-
      contamination is likely to be most significant are those administered by injection
      and those given over a long time. However, contamination of all products poses
      a risk to patient safety dependent on the nature and extent of contamination.

5.19. Cross-contamination should be prevented by attention to design of the premises
      and equipment as described in Chapter 3. This should be supported by attention
      to process design and implementation of any relevant technical or organizational


 PE 009-17 (Part I)                      - 28 -                          25 August 2023
                                                                 Chapter 5      Production



       measures, including effective and reproducible cleaning processes to control risk
       of cross-contamination.

5.20   A Quality Risk Management process, which includes a potency and toxicological
       evaluation, should be used to assess and control the cross-contamination risks
       presented by the products manufactured. Factors including; facility/equipment
       design and use, personnel and material flow, microbiological controls, physico-
       chemical characteristics of the active substance, process characteristics,
       cleaning processes and analytical capabilities relative to the relevant limits
       established from the evaluation of the products should also be taken into account.
       The outcome of the Quality Risk Management process should be the basis for
       determining the necessity for and extent to which premises and equipment should
       be dedicated to a particular product or product family. This may include dedicating
       specific product contact parts or dedication of the entire manufacturing facility. It
       may be acceptable to confine manufacturing activities to a segregated, self-
       contained production area within a multiproduct facility, where justified.

5.21   The outcome of the Quality Risk Management process should be the basis for
       determining the extent of technical and organisational measures required to
       control risks for cross-contamination. These could include, but are not limited to,
       the following:

       Technical Measures

       i.    Dedicated manufacturing facility (premises and equipment);
       ii.   Self-contained production areas having separate processing equipment and
             separate heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. It may
             also be desirable to isolate certain utilities from those used in other areas;
       iii. Design of manufacturing process, premises and equipment to minimize risk
            for cross-contamination during processing, maintenance and cleaning;
       iv. Use of “closed systems” for processing and material/product transfer
           between equipment;
       v.    Use of physical barrier systems, including isolators, as containment
             measures;
       vi. Controlled removal of dust close to source of the contaminant e.g. through
           localised extraction;
       vii. Dedication of equipment, dedication of product contact parts or dedication of
            selected parts which are harder to clean (e.g. filters), dedication of
            maintenance tools;
       viii. Use of single use disposable technologies;
       ix. Use of equipment designed for ease of cleaning;
       x.    Appropriate use of air-locks and pressure cascade to confine potential
             airborne contaminant within a specified area;
       xi. Minimising the risk of contamination caused by recirculation or re-entry of
           untreated or insufficiently treated air;
       xii. Use of automatic clean in place systems of validated effectiveness;



 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 29 -                          25 August 2023
                                                               Chapter 5     Production



       xiii. For common general wash areas, separation of equipment washing, drying
             and storage areas.

       Organisational Measures

       i.    Dedicating the whole manufacturing facility or a self-contained production
             area on a campaign basis (dedicated by separation in time) followed by a
             cleaning process of validated effectiveness;
       ii.   Keeping specific protective clothing inside areas where products with high
             risk of cross-contamination are processed;
       iii. Cleaning verification after each product campaign should be considered as
            a detectability tool to support effectiveness of the Quality Risk Management
            approach for products deemed to present higher risk;

       iv. Depending on the contamination risk, verification of cleaning of non product
           contact surfaces and monitoring of air within the manufacturing area and/or
           adjoining areas in order to demonstrate effectiveness of control measures
           against airborne contamination or contamination by mechanical transfer;
       v.    Specific measures for waste handling, contaminated rinsing water and soiled
             gowning;
       vi. Recording of spills, accidental events or deviations from procedures;
       vii. Design of cleaning processes for premises and equipment such that the
            cleaning processes in themselves do not present a cross-contamination risk;
       viii. Design of detailed records for cleaning processes to assure completion of
             cleaning in accordance with approved procedures and use of cleaning status
             labels on equipment and manufacturing areas;
       ix. Use of common general wash areas on a campaign basis;
       x.    Supervision of working behaviour to ensure training effectiveness and
             compliance with the relevant procedural controls.

5.22   Measures to prevent cross-contamination and their effectiveness should be
       reviewed periodically according to set procedures.


VALIDATION
5.23   Validation studies should reinforce Good Manufacturing Practice and be
       conducted in accordance with defined procedures. Results and conclusions
       should be recorded.

5.24   When any new manufacturing formula or method of preparation is adopted, steps
       should be taken to demonstrate its suitability for routine processing. The defined
       process, using the materials and equipment specified, should be shown to yield
       a product consistently of the required quality.




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                       - 30 -                         25 August 2023
                                                                 Chapter 5      Production



5.25   Significant amendments to the manufacturing process, including any change in
       equipment or materials, which may affect product quality and/or the
       reproducibility of the process, should be validated.

5.26   Processes and procedures should undergo periodic critical re-validation to
       ensure that they remain capable of achieving the intended results.


STARTING MATERIALS

5.27   The selection, qualification, approval and maintenance of suppliers of starting
       materials, together with their purchase and acceptance, should be documented
       as part of the pharmaceutical quality system. The level of supervision should be
       proportionate to the risks posed by the individual materials, taking account of their
       source, manufacturing process, supply chain complexity and the final use to
       which the material is put in the medicinal product. The supporting evidence for
       each supplier / material approval should be maintained. Staff involved in these
       activities should have a current knowledge of the suppliers, the supply chain and
       the associated risks involved. Where possible, starting materials should be
       purchased directly from the manufacturer of the starting material.

5.28   The quality requirements established by the manufacturer for the starting
       materials should be discussed and agreed with the suppliers. Appropriate
       aspects of the production, testing and control, including handling, labelling,
       packaging and distribution requirements, complaints, recalls and rejection
       procedures should be documented in a formal quality agreement or specification.

5.29   For the approval and maintenance of suppliers of active substances and
       excipients, the following is required:

       Active substances

       Supply chain traceability should be established and the associated risks, from
       active substance starting materials to the finished medicinal product, should be
       formally assessed and periodically verified. Appropriate measures should be put
       in place to reduce risks to the quality of the active substance.

       The supply chain and traceability records for each active substance (including
       active substance starting materials) should be available and be retained by the
       manufacturer of the medicinal product.

       Audits should be carried out at the manufacturers and distributors of active
       substances to confirm that they comply with the relevant good manufacturing
       practice and good distribution practice requirements. The holder of the
       manufacturing authorisation shall verify such compliance either by himself/herself
       or through an entity acting on his/her behalf under a contract. For veterinary
       medicinal products, audits should be conducted based on risk.

       Audits should be of an appropriate duration and scope to ensure that a full and
       clear assessment of GMP is made; consideration should be given to potential
       cross- contamination from other materials on site. The report should fully reflect



 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 31 -                          25 August 2023
                                                                      Chapter 5       Production



          what was done and seen on the audit with any deficiencies clearly identified. Any
          required corrective and preventive actions should be implemented.

          Further audits should be undertaken at intervals defined by the quality risk
          management process to ensure the maintenance of standards and continued use
          of the approved supply chain.

          Excipients

          Excipients and excipient suppliers should be controlled appropriately based on
          the results of a formalised quality risk assessment in accordance with the PIC/S
          Guideline PI 045-1 ‘Guidelines on the formalised risk assessment for ascertaining
          the appropriate Good Manufacturing Practice for excipients of medicinal products
          for human use’.

5.30      For each delivery of starting material the containers should be checked for
          integrity of package, including tamper evident seal where relevant, and for
          correspondence between the delivery note, the purchase order, the supplier’s
          labels and approved manufacturer and supplier information maintained by the
          medicinal product manufacturer. The receiving checks on each delivery should
          be documented.

5.31      If one material delivery is made up of different batches, each batch must be
          considered as separate for sampling, testing and release.

5.32      Starting materials in the storage area should be appropriately labelled (see
          section 13). Labels should bear at least the following information:

          i.    The designated name of the product and the internal code reference where
                applicable;
          ii.   A batch number given at receipt;
          iii. Where appropriate, the status of the contents (e.g. in quarantine, on test,
               released, rejected);
          iv.   Where appropriate, an expiry date or a date beyond which retesting is
                necessary.

          When fully computerised storage systems are used, all the above information
          need not necessarily be in a legible form on the label.

5.33      There should be appropriate procedures or measures to assure the identity of the
          contents of each container of starting material. Bulk containers from which
          samples have been drawn should be identified (see Chapter 6).

5.34      Only starting materials which have been released by the Quality Control
          department and which are within their retest date should be used.

5.35      Manufacturers of finished products are responsible for any testing of starting
          materials3 as described in the marketing authorisation dossier. They can utilise


3         A similar approach should apply to packaging materials as stated in section 5.45.


    PE 009-17 (Part I)                         - 32 -                            25 August 2023
                                                                        Chapter 5       Production



          partial or full test results from the approved starting material manufacturer but
          must, as a minimum, perform identification testing4 of each batch according to
          Annex 8.

5.36      The rationale for the outsourcing of this testing should be justified and
          documented and the following requirements should be fulfilled:

          i.    Special attention should be paid to the distribution controls (transport,
                wholesaling, storage and delivery) in order to maintain the quality
                characteristics of the starting materials and to ensure that test results remain
                applicable to the delivered material;
          ii.   The medicinal product manufacturer should perform audits, either itself or via
                third parties, at appropriate intervals based on risk at the site(s) carrying out
                the testing (including sampling) of the starting materials in order to assure
                compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice and with the specifications
                and testing methods described in the marketing authorisation dossier;
          iii. The certificate of analysis provided by the starting material
               manufacturer/supplier should be signed by a designated person with
               appropriate qualifications and experience. The signature assures that each
               batch has been checked for compliance with the agreed product specification
               unless this assurance is provided separately;
          iv. The medicinal product manufacturer should have appropriate experience in
              dealing with the starting material manufacturer (including experience via a
              supplier) including assessment of batches previously received and the
              history of compliance before reducing in-house testing. Any significant
              change in the manufacturing or testing processes should be considered;

          v.    The medicinal product manufacturer should also perform (or via a separately
                approved contract laboratory) a full analysis at appropriate intervals based
                on risk and compare the results with the material manufacturer’s or supplier’s
                certificate of analysis in order to check the reliability of the latter. Should this
                testing identify any discrepancy then an investigation should be performed
                and appropriate measures taken. The acceptance of certificates of analysis
                from the material manufacturer or supplier should be discontinued until these
                measures are completed.

5.37      Starting materials should only be dispensed by designated persons, following a
          written procedure, to ensure that the correct materials are accurately weighed or
          measured into clean and properly labelled containers.

5.38      Each dispensed material and its weight or volume should be independently
          checked and the check recorded.

5.39      Materials dispensed for each batch should be kept together and conspicuously
          labelled as such.




4         Identity testing of starting materials should be performed according to the methods and
          the specifications of the relevant marketing authorisation dossier.


    PE 009-17 (Part I)                          - 33 -                            25 August 2023
                                                               Chapter 5      Production



PROCESSING            OPERATIONS:              INTERMEDIATE            AND          BULK
PRODUCTS
5.40   Before any processing operation is started, steps should be taken to ensure that
       the work area and equipment are clean and free from any starting materials,
       products, product residues or documents not required for the current operation.

5.41   Intermediate and bulk products should be kept under appropriate conditions.

5.42   Critical processes should be validated (see "Validation" in this Chapter).

5.43   Any necessary in-process controls and environmental controls should be carried
       out and recorded.

5.44   Any significant deviation from the expected yield should be recorded and
       investigated.


PACKAGING MATERIALS
5.45   The selection, qualification, approval and maintenance of suppliers of primary
       and printed packaging materials shall be accorded attention similar to that given
       to starting materials.

5.46   Particular attention should be paid to printed materials. They should be stored in
       adequately secure conditions such as to exclude unauthorised access. Cut labels
       and other loose printed materials should be stored and transported in separate
       closed containers so as to avoid mix-ups. Packaging materials should be issued
       for use only by authorised personnel following an approved and documented
       procedure.

5.47   Each delivery or batch of printed or primary packaging material should be given
       a specific reference number or identification mark.

5.48   Outdated or obsolete primary packaging material or printed packaging material
       should be destroyed and this disposal recorded.


PACKAGING OPERATIONS
5.49   When setting up a programme for the packaging operations, particular attention
       should be given to minimising the risk of cross-contamination, mix-ups or
       substitutions. Different products should not be packaged in close proximity unless
       there is physical segregation.

5.50   Before packaging operations are begun, steps should be taken to ensure that the
       work area, packaging lines, printing machines and other equipment are clean and
       free from any products, materials or documents previously used, if these are not
       required for the current operation. The line-clearance should be performed
       according to an appropriate check-list.



 PE 009-17 (Part I)                       - 34 -                         25 August 2023
                                                                 Chapter 5      Production




5.51   The name and batch number of the product being handled should be displayed
       at each packaging station or line.

5.52   All products and packaging materials to be used should be checked on delivery
       to the packaging department for quantity, identity and conformity with the
       Packaging Instructions.

5.53   Containers for filling should be clean before filling. Attention should be given to
       avoid and remove any contaminants such as glass fragments and metal particles.

5.54   Normally, filling and sealing should be followed as quickly as possible by labelling.
       If it is not the case, appropriate procedures should be applied to ensure that no
       mix-ups or mislabelling can occur.

5.55   The correct performance of any printing operation (for example code numbers,
       expiry dates) to be done separately or in the course of the packaging should be
       checked and recorded. Attention should be paid to printing by hand which should
       be re-checked at regular intervals.

5.56   Special care should be taken when using cut-labels and when over-printing is
       carried out off-line. Roll-feed labels are normally preferable to cut-labels, in
       helping to avoid mix-ups.

5.57   Checks should be made to ensure that any electronic code readers, label
       counters or similar devices are operating correctly.

5.58   Printed and embossed information on packaging materials should be distinct and
       resistant to fading or erasing.

5.59   On-line control of the product during packaging should include at least checking
       the following:
       i. General appearance of the packages;
       ii. Whether the packages are complete;
       iii. Whether the correct products and packaging materials are used;
       iv. Whether any over-printing is correct;
       v. Correct functioning of line monitors.
       Samples taken away from the packaging line should not be returned.

5.60   Products which have been involved in an unusual event should only be
       reintroduced into the process after special inspection, investigation and approval
       by authorised personnel. Detailed record should be kept of this operation.

5.61   Any significant or unusual discrepancy observed during reconciliation of the
       amount of bulk product and printed packaging materials and the number of units
       produced should be investigated and satisfactorily accounted for before release.

5.62   Upon completion of a packaging operation, any unused batch-coded packaging
       materials should be destroyed and the destruction recorded. A documented
       procedure should be followed if un-coded printed materials are returned to stock.


FINISHED PRODUCTS
5.63   Finished products should be held in quarantine until their final release under
       conditions established by the manufacturer.

5.64   The evaluation of finished products and documentation which is necessary before
       release of product for sale is described in Chapter 6 (Quality Control).

5.65   After release, finished products should be stored as usable stock under
       conditions established by the manufacturer.


REJECTED, RECOVERED AND RETURNED MATERIALS
5.66   Rejected materials and products should be clearly marked as such and stored
       separately in restricted areas. They should either be returned to the suppliers or,
       where appropriate, reprocessed or destroyed. Whatever action is taken should
       be approved and recorded by authorised personnel.

5.67   The reprocessing of rejected products should be exceptional. It is only permitted
       if the quality of the final product is not affected, if the specifications are met and
       if it is done in accordance with a defined and authorised procedure after
       evaluation of the risks involved. Record should be kept of the reprocessing.

5.68   The recovery of all or part of earlier batches which conform to the required quality
       by incorporation into a batch of the same product at a defined stage of
       manufacture should be authorised beforehand. This recovery should be carried
       out in accordance with a defined procedure after evaluation of the risks involved,
       including any possible effect on shelf life. The recovery should be recorded.

5.69   The need for additional testing of any finished product which has been
       reprocessed, or into which a recovered product has been incorporated, should
       be considered by the Quality Control Department.

5.70   Products returned from the market and which have left the control of the
       manufacturer should be destroyed unless without doubt their quality is
       satisfactory; they may be considered for re-sale, re-labelling or recovery in a
       subsequent batch only after they have been critically assessed by the Quality
       Control Department in accordance with a written procedure. The nature of the
       product, any special storage conditions it requires, its condition and history, and
       the time elapsed since it was issued should all be taken into account in this
       assessment. Where any doubt arises over the quality of the product, it should not
       be considered suitable for re-issue or re-use, although basic chemical
       reprocessing to recover active ingredient may be possible. Any action taken
       should be appropriately recorded.

PRODUCT   SHORTAGE                        DUE         TO        MANUFACTURING
CONSTRAINTS
5.71   The manufacturer should report to the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) any
       constraints in manufacturing operations which may result in abnormal restriction
       in the supply. This should be done in a timely manner to facilitate reporting of the
       restriction in supply by the MAH, to the relevant competent authorities, in
       accordance with its legal obligations.

CHAPTER 6

                            QUALITY CONTROL


PRINCIPLE
       This chapter should be read in conjunction with all relevant sections of the GMP
       guide.

       Quality Control is concerned with sampling, specifications and testing as well as
       the organisation, documentation and release procedures which ensure that the
       necessary and relevant tests are carried out, and that materials are not released
       for use, nor products released for sale or supply, until their quality has been
       judged satisfactory. Quality Control is not confined to laboratory operations, but
       must be involved in all decisions which may concern the quality of the product.
       The independence of Quality Control from Production is considered fundamental
       to the satisfactory operation of Quality Control.


GENERAL
6.1    Each holder of a manufacturing authorisation should have a Quality Control
       Department. This department should be independent from other departments,
       and under the authority of a person with appropriate qualifications and
       experience, who has one or several control laboratories at his disposal. Adequate
       resources must be available to ensure that all the Quality Control arrangements
       are effectively and reliably carried out.

6.2    The principal duties of the head of Quality Control are summarised in Chapter 2.
       The Quality Control Department as a whole will also have other duties, such as
       to establish, validate and implement all quality control procedures, oversee the
       control of the reference and/or retention samples of materials and products when
       applicable, ensure the correct labelling of containers of materials and products,
       ensure the monitoring of the stability of the products, participate in the
       investigation of complaints related to the quality of the product, etc. All these
       operations should be carried out in accordance with written procedures and,
       where necessary, recorded.

6.3    Finished product assessment should embrace all relevant factors, including
       production conditions, results of in-process testing, a review of manufacturing
       (including packaging) documentation, compliance with Finished Product
       Specification and examination of the final finished pack.

6.4    Quality Control personnel should have access to production areas for sampling
       and investigation as appropriate.




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                      - 38 -                          25 August 2023
                                                                  Chapter 6    Quality control



GOOD QUALITY CONTROL LABORATORY PRATCTICE
6.5    Control laboratory premises and equipment should meet the general and specific
       requirements for Quality Control areas given in Chapter 3. Laboratory equipment
       should not be routinely moved between high risk areas to avoid accidental cross-
       contamination. In particular, the microbiological laboratory should be arranged so
       as to minimize risk of cross-contamination.

6.6    The personnel, premises, and equipment in the laboratories should be
       appropriate to the tasks imposed by the nature and the scale of the manufacturing
       operations. The use of outside laboratories, in conformity with the principles
       detailed in Chapter 7, Outsourced Activities, can be accepted for particular
       reasons, but this should be stated in the Quality Control records.


Documentation

6.7    Laboratory documentation should follow the principles given in Chapter 4. An
       important part of this documentation deals with Quality Control and the following
       details should be readily available to the Quality Control Department:

       (i)     Specifications;

       (ii)    Procedures describing sampling, testing, records (including                test
               worksheets and/or laboratory notebooks), recording and verifying;

       (iii)   Procedures for and records of the calibration/qualification of instruments
               and maintenance of equipment;

       (iv)    A procedure for the investigation of Out of Specification and Out of Trend
               results;

       (v)     Testing reports and/or certificates of analysis;

       (vi)    Data from environmental (air, water and other utilities) monitoring, where
               required;

       (vii) Validation records of test methods, where applicable.

6.8    Any Quality Control documentation relating to a batch record should be retained
       following the principles given in Chapter 4 on retention of batch documentation.

6.9    Some kinds of data (e.g. tests results, yields, environmental controls) should be
       recorded in a manner permitting trend evaluation. Any Out of Trend or Out of
       Specification data should be addressed and subject to investigation.

6.10   In addition to the information which is part of the batch documentation, other raw
       data such as laboratory notebooks and/or records should be retained and readily
       available.




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                         - 39 -                            25 August 2023
                                                               Chapter 6    Quality control



Sampling

6.11   The sample taking should be done and recorded in accordance with approved
       written procedures that describe:

       (i)     The method of sampling;

       (ii)    The equipment to be used;

       (iii)   The amount of the sample to be taken;

       (iv)    Instructions for any required sub-division of the sample;

       (v)     The type and condition of the sample container to be used;

       (vi)    The identification of containers sampled;

       (vii) Any special precautions to be observed, especially with regard to the
             sampling of sterile or noxious materials;

       (viii) The storage conditions;

       (ix)    Instructions for the cleaning and storage of sampling equipment.

6.12   Samples should be representative of the batch of materials or products from
       which they are taken. Other samples may also be taken to monitor the most
       stressed part of a process (e.g. beginning or end of a process). The sampling
       plan used should be appropriately justified and based on a risk management
       approach.

6.13   Sample containers should bear a label indicating the contents, with the batch
       number, the date of sampling and the containers from which samples have been
       drawn. They should be managed in a manner to minimize the risk of mix-up and
       to protect the samples from adverse storage conditions.

6.14   Further guidance on reference and retention samples is given in Annex 19.


Testing

6.15   Testing methods should be validated. A laboratory that is using a testing method
       and which did not perform the original validation, should verify the
       appropriateness of the testing method. All testing operations described in the
       Marketing Authorisation or technical dossier should be carried out according to
       the approved methods.

6.16   The results obtained should be recorded. Results of parameters identified as
       critical quality attributes should be trended and checked to make sure that they
       are consistent with each other. Any calculations should be critically examined.

6.17   The tests performed should be recorded and the records should include at least
       the following data:



 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 40 -                          25 August 2023
                                                              Chapter 6    Quality control



       (i)     Name of the material or product and, where applicable, dosage form;

       (ii)    Batch number and, where appropriate, the manufacturer and/or supplier;

       (iii)   References to the relevant specifications and testing procedures;

       (iv)    Test results, including observations and calculations, and reference to any
               certificates of analysis;

       (v)     Dates of testing;

       (vi)    Initials of the persons who performed the testing;

       (vii) Initials of the persons who verified the testing and the calculations, where
             appropriate;

       (viii) A clear statement of approval or rejection (or other status decision) and the
              dated signature of the designated responsible person;

       (ix)    Reference to the equipment used.

6.18   All the in-process controls, including those made in the production area by
       production personnel, should be performed according to methods approved by
       Quality Control and the results recorded.

6.19   Special attention should be given to the quality of laboratory reagents, solutions,
       glassware, reference standards and culture media. They should be prepared and
       controlled in accordance with written procedures. The level of controls should be
       commensurate to their use and to the available stability data.

6.20   Reference standards should be established as suitable for their intended use.
       Their qualification and certification, as such, should be clearly stated and
       documented. Whenever compendial reference standards from an officially
       recognised source exist, these should preferably be used as primary reference
       standards unless fully justified (the use of secondary standards is permitted once
       their traceability to primary standards has been demonstrated and is
       documented). These compendial materials should be used for the purpose
       described in the appropriate monograph unless otherwise authorised by the
       National Competent Authority.

6.21   Laboratory reagents, solutions, reference standards and culture media should be
       marked with the preparation and opening date and the signature of the person
       who prepared them. The expiry date of reagents and culture media should be
       indicated on the label, together with specific storage conditions. In addition, for
       volumetric solutions, the last date of standardisation and the last current factor
       should be indicated.

6.22   Where necessary, the date of receipt of any substance used for testing operations
       (e.g. reagents, solutions and reference standards) should be indicated on the
       container. Instructions for use and storage should be followed. In certain cases it
       may be necessary to carry out an identification test and/or other testing of reagent
       materials upon receipt or before use.



 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 41 -                         25 August 2023
                                                              Chapter 6     Quality control



6.23   Culture media should be prepared in accordance with the media manufacturer’s
       requirements unless scientifically justified. The performance of all culture media
       should be verified prior to use.

6.24   Used microbiological media and strains should be decontaminated according to
       a standard procedure and disposed of in a manner to prevent the cross-
       contamination and retention of residues. The in-use shelf life of microbiological
       media should be established, documented and scientifically justified.

6.25   Animals used for testing components, materials or products, should, where
       appropriate, be quarantined before use. They should be maintained and
       controlled in a manner that assures their suitability for the intended use. They
       should be identified, and adequate records should be maintained, showing the
       history of their use.


On-going stability programme

6.26   After marketing, the stability of the medicinal product should be monitored
       according to a continuous appropriate programme that will permit the detection
       of any stability issue (e.g. changes in levels of impurities or dissolution profile)
       associated with the formulation in the marketed package.

6.27   The purpose of the on-going stability programme is to monitor the product over
       its shelf life and to determine that the product remains, and can be expected to
       remain, within specifications under the labelled storage conditions.

6.28   This mainly applies to the medicinal product in the package in which it is sold, but
       consideration should also be given to the inclusion in the programme of bulk
       product. For example, when the bulk product is stored for a long period before
       being packaged and/or shipped from a manufacturing site to a packaging site,
       the impact on the stability of the packaged product should be evaluated and
       studied under ambient conditions. In addition, consideration should be given to
       intermediates that are stored and used over prolonged periods. Stability studies
       on reconstituted product are performed during product development and need
       not be monitored on an on-going basis. However, when relevant, the stability of
       reconstituted product can also be monitored.

6.29   The ongoing stability programme should be described in a written protocol
       following the general rules of Chapter 4 and results formalised as a report. The
       equipment used for the ongoing stability programme (stability chambers among
       others) should be qualified and maintained following the general rules of
       Chapter 3 and Annex 15.

6.30   The protocol for an on-going stability programme should extend to the end of the
       shelf life period and should include, but not be limited to, the following
       parameters:

       (i)     Number of batch(es) per strength and different batch sizes, if applicable;

       (ii)    Relevant physical, chemical, microbiological and biological test methods;

       (iii)   Acceptance criteria;


 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 42 -                          25 August 2023
                                                                Chapter 6    Quality control




       (iv)   Reference to test methods;

       (v)    Description of the container closure system(s);

       (vi)   Testing intervals (time points);

       (vii) Description of the conditions of storage (standardised ICH/VICH conditions
             for long term testing, consistent with the product labelling, should be used);

       (viii) Other applicable parameters specific to the medicinal product.

6.31   The protocol for the on-going stability programme can be different from that of the
       initial long term stability study as submitted in the Marketing Authorisation dossier
       provided that this is justified and documented in the protocol (for example the
       frequency of testing, or when updating to ICH/VICH recommendations).

6.32   The number of batches and frequency of testing should provide a sufficient
       amount of data to allow for trend analysis. Unless otherwise justified, at least one
       batch per year of product manufactured in every strength and every primary
       packaging type, if relevant, should be included in the stability programme (unless
       none are produced during that year). For products where on-going stability
       monitoring would normally require testing using animals and no appropriate
       alternative, validated techniques are available, the frequency of testing may take
       account of a risk-benefit approach. The principle of bracketing and matrixing
       designs may be applied if scientifically justified in the protocol.

6.33   In certain situations, additional batches should be included in the on-going
       stability programme. For example, an on-going stability study should be
       conducted after any significant change or significant deviation to the process or
       package. Any reworking, reprocessing or recovery operation should also be
       considered for inclusion.

6.34   Results of on-going stability studies should be made available to key personnel
       and, in particular, to the Authorised Person(s). Where on-going stability studies
       are carried out at a site other than the site of manufacture of the bulk or finished
       product, there should be a written agreement between the parties concerned.
       Results of on-going stability studies should be available at the site of manufacture
       for review by the competent authority.

6.35   Out of specification or significant atypical trends should be investigated. Any
       confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, affecting
       product batches released on the market should be reported to the relevant
       competent authorities. The possible impact on batches on the market should be
       considered in accordance with Chapter 8 of the GMP Guide and in consultation
       with the relevant competent authorities.

6.36   A summary of all the data generated, including any interim conclusions on the
       programme, should be written and maintained. This summary should be
       subjected to periodic review.




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 43 -                           25 August 2023

Technical transfer of testing methods

6.37   Prior to transferring a test method, the transferring site should verify that the test
       method(s) comply with those as described in the Marketing Authorisation or the
       relevant technical dossier. The original validation of the test method(s) should be
       reviewed to ensure compliance with current ICH/VICH requirements. A gap
       analysis should be performed and documented to identify any supplementary
       validation that should be performed, prior to commencing the technical transfer
       process.

6.38   The transfer of testing methods from one laboratory (transferring laboratory) to
       another laboratory (receiving laboratory) should be described in a detailed
       protocol.

6.39   The transfer protocol should include, but not be limited to, the following
       parameters:

       (i)     Identification of the testing to be performed and the relevant test method(s)
               undergoing transfer;

       (ii)    Identification of the additional training requirements;

       (iii)   Identification of standards and samples to be tested;

       (iv)    Identification of any special transport and storage conditions of test items;

       (v)     The acceptance criteria which should be based upon the current validation
               study of the methodology and with respect to ICH/VICH requirements.

6.40   Deviations from the protocol should be investigated prior to closure of the
       technical transfer process. The technical transfer report should document the
       comparative outcome of the process and should identify areas requiring further
       test method revalidation, if applicable.

6.41   Where appropriate, specific requirements described in other guidelines should be
       addressed for the transfer of particular testing methods (e.g. Near Infrared
       Spectroscopy).

                                                       Chapter 7     Outsourced activities



CHAPTER 7

                      OUTSOURCED ACTIVITIES


PRINCIPLE
       Any activity covered by the GMP Guide that is outsourced should be appropriately
       defined, agreed and controlled in order to avoid misunderstandings which could
       result in a product or operation of unsatisfactory quality. There must be a written
       contract between the Contract Giver and the Contract Acceptor which clearly
       establishes the roles and responsibilities of each party. The Pharmaceutical
       Quality System of the Contract Giver must clearly state the way that the
       Authorised Person certifying each batch of product for release exercises his/her
       full responsibility.

       Note: This Chapter deals with the responsibilities of manufacturers towards the
       Competent Regulatory Authorities with respect to the granting of marketing and
       manufacturing authorisations. It is not intended in any way to affect the respective
       liability of Contract Acceptors and Contract Givers to consumers; this is governed
       by other provisions of national law.


GENERAL
7.1    There should be a written contract covering the outsourced activities, the
       products or operations to which they are related, and any technical arrangements
       made in connection with it.

7.2    All arrangements for the outsourced activities including any proposed changes in
       technical or other arrangements should be in accordance with regulations in
       force, and the Marketing Authorisation for the product concerned, where
       applicable.

7.3    Where the Marketing Authorisation holder and the manufacturer are not the
       same, appropriate arrangements should be in place, taking into account the
       principles described in this chapter.


THE CONTRACT GIVER
7.4    The Pharmaceutical Quality System of the Contract Giver should include the
       control and review of any outsourced activities. The Contract Giver is ultimately
       responsible to ensure processes are in place to assure the control of outsourced
       activities. These processes should incorporate quality risk management
       principles and notably include:

       7.4.1 Prior to outsourcing activities, the Contract Giver is responsible for

              Acceptor to carry out successfully the outsourced activities. The Contract
              Giver is also responsible for ensuring by means of the contract that the
              principles and guidelines of GMP as interpreted in this Guide are followed;

       7.4.2 The Contract Giver should provide the Contract Acceptor with all the
             information and knowledge necessary to carry out the contracted
             operations correctly in accordance with regulations in force, and the
             Marketing Authorisation for the product concerned. The Contract Giver
             should ensure that the Contract Acceptor is fully aware of any problems
             associated with the product or the work which might pose a hazard to
             his/her premises, equipment, personnel, other materials or other products;

       7.4.3 The Contract Giver should monitor and review the performance of the
             Contract Acceptor and the identification and implementation of any needed
             improvement.

7.5    The Contract Giver should be responsible for reviewing and assessing the
       records and the results related to the outsourced activities. He/she should also
       ensure, either by himself/herself, or based on the confirmation of the Contract
       Acceptor’s Authorised Person, that all products and materials delivered to him/her
       by the Contract Acceptor have been processed in accordance with GMP and the
       Marketing Authorisation.


THE CONTRACT ACCEPTOR
7.6    The Contract Acceptor must be able to carry out satisfactorily the work ordered
       by the Contract Giver such as having adequate premises, equipment, knowledge,
       experience, and competent personnel.

7.7    The Contract Acceptor should ensure that all products, materials and knowledge
       delivered to him/her are suitable for their intended purpose.

7.8    The Contract Acceptor should not subcontract to a third party any of the work
       entrusted to him/her under the contract without the Contract Giver’s prior
       evaluation and approval of the arrangements. Arrangements made between the
       Contract Acceptor and any third party should ensure that information and
       knowledge, including those from assessments of the suitability of the third party,
       are made available in the same way as between the original Contract Giver and
       Contract Acceptor.

7.9    The Contract Acceptor should not make unauthorised changes, outside the terms
       of the Contract, which may adversely affect the quality of the outsourced activities
       for the Contract Giver.

7.10   The Contract Acceptor should understand that outsourced activities, including
       contract analysis, may be subject to inspection by the competent authorities.

THE CONTRACT
7.11   A contract should be drawn up between the Contract Giver and the Contract
       Acceptor which specifies their respective responsibilities and communication
       processes relating to the outsourced activities. Technical aspects of the contract
       should be drawn up by competent persons suitably knowledgeable in related
       outsourced activities and Good Manufacturing Practice. All arrangements for
       outsourced activities must be in accordance with regulations in force and the
       Marketing Authorisation for the product concerned and agreed by both parties.

7.12   The contract should describe clearly which party to the contract has responsibility
       for conducting each step of the outsourced activity, e.g. knowledge management,
       technology transfer, supply chain, subcontracting, quality and purchasing of
       materials, testing and releasing materials, undertaking production and quality
       controls (including in-process controls, sampling and analysis).

7.13   All records related to the outsourced activities, e.g. manufacturing, analytical and
       distribution records, and reference samples, should be kept by, or be available
       to, the Contract Giver. Any records relevant to assessing the quality of a product
       in the event of complaints or a suspected defect or to investigating in the case of
       a suspected falsified product must be accessible and specified in the relevant
       procedures of the Contract Giver.

7.14   The contract should permit the Contract Giver to audit outsourced activities,
       performed by the Contract Acceptor or their mutually agreed subcontractors.




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                       - 47 -                          25 August 2023
                                             Chapter 8     Complaints and product recall



CHAPTER 8

              COMPLAINTS AND PRODUCT RECALL


PRINCIPLE
       In order to protect public and animal health, a system and appropriate procedures
       should be in place to record, assess, investigate and review complaints including
       potential quality defects, and if necessary, to effectively and promptly recall
       medicinal products for human or veterinary use and investigational medicinal
       products from the distribution network. Quality Risk Management principles
       should be applied to the investigation and assessment of quality defects and to
       the decision-making process in relation to product recalls corrective and
       preventative actions and other risk-reducing actions. Guidance in relation to these
       principles is provided in Chapter 1.

       All concerned Competent Authorities should be informed in a timely manner in
       case of a confirmed quality defect (faulty manufacture, product deterioration,
       detection of falsification, non-compliance with the marketing authorisation or
       product specification file, or any other serious quality problems) with a medicinal
       or investigational medicinal product which may result in the recall of the product
       or an abnormal restriction in the supply. In situations where product on the market
       is found to be non-compliant with the marketing authorisation, there may be a
       requirement to notify concerned Competent Authorities. Reference should be
       made to relevant legislative requirements.

       In case of outsourced activities, a contract should describe the role and
       responsibilities of the manufacturer, the marketing authorisation holder and/or
       sponsor and any other relevant third parties in relation to assessment, decision-
       making, and dissemination of information and implementation of risk-reducing
       actions relating to a defective product. Guidance in relation to contracts is
       provided in Chapter 7. Such contracts should also address how to contact those
       responsible at each party for the management of quality defect and recall issues.


PERSONNEL AND ORGANISATION
8.1    Appropriately trained and experienced personnel should be responsible for
       managing complaint and quality defect investigations and for deciding the
       measures to be taken to manage any potential risk(s) presented by those issues,
       including recalls. These persons should be independent of the sales and
       marketing organisation, unless otherwise justified. If these persons do not include
       the Authorised Person involved in the certification for release of the concerned
       batch or batches, the latter should be made formally aware of any investigations,
       any risk-reducing actions and any recall operations, in a timely manner.

8.2    Sufficient trained personnel and resources should be made available for the
       handling, assessment, investigation and review of complaints and quality defects



 PE 009-17 (Part I)                       - 48 -                         25 August 2023
                                              Chapter 8        Complaints and product recall



       and for implementing any risk-reducing actions. Sufficient trained personnel and
       resources should also be available for the management of interactions with
       Competent Authorities.

8.3    The use of inter-disciplinary teams should be considered, including appropriately
       trained Quality Management personnel.

8.4    In situations in which complaint and quality defect handling is managed centrally
       within an organisation, the relative roles and responsibilities of the concerned
       parties should be documented. Central management should not, however, result
       in delays in the investigation and management of the issue.


PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING        AND INVESTIGATING
    COMPLAINTS INCLUDING POSSIBLE QUALITY DEFECTS
8.5    There should be written procedures describing the actions to be taken upon
       receipt of a complaint. All complaints should be documented and assessed to
       establish if they represent a potential quality defect or other issue.

8.6    Special attention should be given to establishing whether a complaint or
       suspected quality defect relates to falsification.

8.7    As not all complaints received by a company may represent actual quality
       defects, complaints which do not indicate a potential quality defect should be
       documented appropriately and communicated to the relevant group or person
       responsible for the investigation and management of complaints of that nature,
       such as suspected adverse events.

8.8    There should be procedures in place to facilitate a request to investigate the
       quality of a batch of a medicinal product in order to support an investigation into
       a reported suspected adverse event.

8.9    When a quality defect investigation is initiated, procedures should be in place to
       address at least the following:

       i.    The description of the reported quality defect.

       ii.   The determination of the extent of the quality defect. The checking or testing
             of reference and/or retention samples should be considered as part of this,
             and in certain cases, a review of the batch production record, the batch
             certification record and the batch distribution records (especially for
             temperature-sensitive products) should be performed.

       iii. The need to request a sample, or the return, of the defective product from
            the complainant and, where a sample is provided, the need for an
            appropriate evaluation to be carried out.

       iv. The assessment of the risk(s) posed by the quality defect, based on the
           severity and extent of the quality defect.




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 49 -                           25 August 2023
                                               Chapter 8     Complaints and product recall



       v.   The decision-making process that is to be used concerning the potential
            need for risk-reducing actions to be taken in the distribution network, such as
            batch or product recalls, or other actions.

       vi. The assessment of the impact that any recall action may have on the
           availability of the medicinal product to patients/animals in any affected
           market, and the need to notify the relevant authorities of such impact.

       vii. The internal and external communications that should be made in relation to
            a quality defect and its investigation.

       viii. The identification of the potential root cause(s) of the quality defect.

       ix. The need for appropriate Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs) to be
            identified and implemented for the issue, and for the assessment of the
            effectiveness of those CAPAs.


INVESTIGATION AND DECISION-MAKING

8.10   The information reported in relation to possible quality defects should be
       recorded, including all the original details. The validity and extent of all reported
       quality defects should be documented and assessed in accordance with Quality
       Risk Management principles in order to support decisions regarding the degree
       of investigation and action taken.

8.11   If a quality defect is discovered or suspected in a batch, consideration should be
       given to checking other batches and in some cases other products, in order to
       determine whether they are also affected. In particular, other batches which may
       contain portions of the defective batch or defective components should be
       investigated.

8.12   Quality defect investigations should include a review of previous quality defect
       reports or any other relevant information for any indication of specific or recurring
       problems requiring attention and possibly further regulatory action.

8.13   The decisions that are made during and following quality defect investigations
       should reflect the level of risk that is presented by the quality defect as well as
       the seriousness of any non-compliance with respect to the requirements of the
       marketing authorisation/product specification file or GMP. Such decisions should
       be timely to ensure that patient and animal safety is maintained, in a way that is
       commensurate with the level of risk that is presented by those issues.

8.14   As comprehensive information on the nature and extent of the quality defect may
       not always be available at the early stages of an investigation, the decision-
       making processes should still ensure that appropriate risk-reducing actions are
       taken at an appropriate time-point during such investigations. All the decisions
       and measures taken as a result of a quality defect should be documented.

8.15   Quality defects should be reported in a timely manner by the manufacturer to the
       marketing authorisation holder/sponsor and all concerned Competent Authorities




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                         - 50 -                           25 August 2023
                                               Chapter 8     Complaints and product recall



       in cases where the quality defect may result in the recall of the product or in an
       abnormal restriction in the supply of the product.


ROOT  CAUSE   ANALYSIS                              AND      CORRECTIVE                AND
   PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS
8.16   An appropriate level of root cause analysis work should be applied during the
       investigation of quality defects. In cases where the true root cause(s) of the
       quality defect cannot be determined, consideration should be given to identifying
       the most likely root cause(s) and to addressing those.

8.17   Where human error is suspected or identified as the cause of a quality defect,
       this should be formally justified and care should be exercised so as to ensure that
       process, procedural or system-based errors or problems are not overlooked, if
       present.

8.18   Appropriate CAPAs should be identified and taken in response to a quality defect.
       The effectiveness of such actions should be monitored and assessed.

8.19   Quality defect records should be reviewed and trend analyses should be
       performed regularly for any indication of specific or recurring problems requiring
       attention.


PRODUCT RECALLS AND OTHER POTENTIAL RISK-REDUCING
    ACTIONS
8.20   There should be established written procedures, regularly reviewed and updated
       when necessary, in order to undertake any recall activity or implement any other
       risk-reducing actions.

8.21   After a product has been placed on the market, any retrieval of it from the
       distribution network as a result of a quality defect should be regarded and
       managed as a recall. (This provision does not apply to the retrieval (or return) of
       samples of the product from the distribution network to facilitate an investigation
       into a quality defect issue/report.)

8.22   Recall operations should be capable of being initiated promptly and at any time.
       In certain cases recall operations may need to be initiated to protect public or
       animal health prior to establishing the root cause(s) and full extent of the quality
       defect

8.23   The batch/product distribution records should be readily available to the persons
       responsible for recalls, and should contain sufficient information on wholesalers
       and directly supplied customers (with addresses, phone and/or fax numbers
       inside and outside working hours, batches and amounts delivered), including
       those for exported products and medical samples.

8.24   In the case of investigational medicinal products, all trial sites should be identified
       and the countries of destination should be indicated. In the case of an
       investigational medicinal product for which a marketing authorisation has been


 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 51 -                            25 August 2023
                                              Chapter 8     Complaints and product recall



       issued, the manufacturer of the investigational medicinal product should, in
       cooperation with the sponsor, inform the marketing authorisation holder of any
       quality defect that could be related to the authorised medicinal product. The
       sponsor should implement a procedure for the rapid unblinding of blinded
       products, where this is necessary for a prompt recall. The sponsor should ensure
       that the procedure discloses the identity of the blinded product only in so far as
       is necessary.

8.25   Consideration should be given following consultation with the concerned
       Competent Authorities, as to how far into the distribution network a recall action
       should extend, taking into account the potential risk to public or animal health and
       any impact that the proposed recall action may have. The Competent Authorities
       should also be informed in situations in which no recall action is being proposed
       for a defective batch because the batch has expired (such as with short shelf-life
       products.)

8.26   All concerned Competent Authorities should be informed in advance in cases
       where products are intended to be recalled. For very serious issues (i.e. those
       with the potential to seriously impact upon patient or animal health), rapid risk-
       reducing actions (such as a product recall) may have to be taken in advance of
       notifying the Competent Authorities. Wherever possible, attempts should be
       made to agree these in advance of their execution with the concerned Competent
       Authorities

8.27   It should also be considered whether the proposed recall action may affect
       different markets in different ways, and if this is the case, appropriate market-
       specific risk-reducing actions should be developed and discussed with the
       concerned Competent Authorities. Taking account of its therapeutic use the risk
       of shortage of a medicinal product which has no authorised alternative should be
       considered before deciding on a risk-reducing action such as a recall. Any
       decisions not to execute a risk-reducing action which would otherwise be required
       should be agreed with the Competent Authority in advance.

8.28   Recalled products should be identified and stored separately in a secure area
       while awaiting a decision on their fate. A formal disposition of all recalled batches
       should be made and documented. The rationale for any decision to rework
       recalled products should be documented and discussed with the relevant
       Competent Authority. The extent of shelf-life remaining for any reworked batches
       that are being considered for placement onto the market should also be
       considered.

8.29   The progress of the recall process should be recorded until closure and a final
       report issued, including a reconciliation between the delivered and recovered
       quantities of the concerned products/batches.

8.30   The effectiveness of the arrangements in place for recalls should be periodically
       evaluated to confirm that they remain robust and fit for use. Such evaluations
       should extend to both within office-hour situations as well as out-of-office hour
       situations and, when performing such evaluations, consideration should be given
       as to whether mock-recall actions should be performed. This evaluation should
       be documented and justified.




 PE 009-17 (Part I)                        - 52 -                          25 August 2023

8.31   In addition to recalls, there are other potential risk-reducing actions that may be
       considered in order to manage the risks presented by quality defects. Such
       actions may include the issuance of cautionary communications to healthcare
       professionals in relation to their use of a batch that is potentially defective. These
       should be considered on a case-by-case basis and discussed with the concerned
       Competent Authorities.

CHAPTER 9

                            SELF INSPECTION


PRINCIPLE

       Self inspections should be conducted in order to monitor the implementation and
       compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice principles and to propose
       necessary corrective measures.

9.1.   Personnel matters, premises, equipment, documentation, production, quality
       control, distribution of the medicinal products, arrangements for dealing with
       complaints and recalls, and self inspection, should be examined at intervals
       following a pre-arranged programme in order to verify their conformity with the
       principles of Quality Assurance.

9.2.   Self inspections should be conducted in an independent and detailed way by
       designated competent person(s) from the company. Independent audits by
       external experts may also be useful.

9.3.   All self inspections should be recorded. Reports should contain all the
       observations made during the inspections and, where applicable, proposals for
       corrective measures. Statements on the actions subsequently taken should also
       be recorded.
