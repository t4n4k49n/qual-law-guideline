      text: 'The manufacture of sterile products covers a wide range of sterile product types (active substance, excipient, primary packaging material and finished dosage form), packed sizes (single unit to multiple units), processes (from highly automated systems to manual processes) and technologies (e.g. biotechnology, classical small molecule manufacturing systems and closed systems). This Annex provides general guidance that should be used in the design and control of facilities, equipment, systems and procedures used for the manufacture of all sterile products applying the principles of Quality Risk Management (QRM), to ensure that microbial, particulate and endotoxin/pyrogen contamination is prevented in the final product.


        QRM applies to this document in its entirety and will not, normally, be referred to in specific paragraphs. Where specific limits or frequencies or ranges are specified, these should be considered as a minimum requirement. They are stated due to historical regulatory experience of issues that have been identified and have impacted the safety of patients.


        The intent of the Annex is to provide guidance for the manufacture of sterile products. However, some of the principles and guidance, such as contamination control strategy, design of premises, cleanroom classification, qualification, validation, monitoring and personnel gowning, may be used to support the manufacture of other products that are not intended to be sterile such as certain liquids, creams, ointments and low bioburden biological intermediates, but where the control and reduction of microbial, particulate and endotoxin/pyrogen contamination is considered important. Where a manufacturer elects to apply guidance herein to non-sterile products, the manufacturer should clearly document which principles have been applied and acknowledge that compliance with those principles should be demonstrated.'

          In the first instance, QRM priorities should include appropriate design of the facility, equipment and processes, followed by the implementation of welldesigned procedures, and finally application of monitoring systems as the element that demonstrates that the design and procedures have been correctly implemented and continue to perform in line with expectations.

        text: A Contamination Control Strategy (CCS) should be implemented across the facility in order to define all critical control points and assess the effectiveness of all the controls (design, procedural, technical and organisational) and monitoring measures employed to manage risks to medicinal product quality and safety. The combined strategy of the CCS should establish robust assurance of contamination prevention. The CCS should be actively reviewed and, where appropriate, updated and should drive continual improvement of the manufacturing and control methods. Its effectiveness should form part of the periodic management review. Where existing control systems are in place and are appropriately managed, these may not require replacement but should be referenced in the CCS and the associated interactions between systems should be understood.

        text: 'For the manufacture of sterile products there are four grades of cleanroom/zone. Grade A: The critical zone for high-risk operations (e.g. aseptic processing line, filling zone, stopper bowl, open primary packaging or for making aseptic connections under the protection of first air). Normally, such conditions are provided by a localised airflow protection, such as unidirectional airflow workstations within RABS or isolators. The maintenance of unidirectional airflow should be demonstrated and qualified across the whole of the grade A area. Direct intervention (e.g. without the protection of barrier and glove port technology) into the grade A area by operators should be minimized by premises, equipment, process and procedural design. Grade B: For aseptic preparation and filling, this is the background cleanroom for grade A (where it is not an isolator). Air pressure differences should be continuously monitored. Cleanrooms of lower grade than grade B can be considered where isolator technology is used (see paragraph 4.20). Grade C and D: These are cleanrooms used for carrying out less critical stages in the manufacture of aseptically filled sterile products or as a background for isolators. They can also be used for the preparation/filling of terminally sterilised products. (See section 8 for the specific details on terminal sterilisation activities).'

Where possible, items should be sterilised and passed into these areas through double-ended sterilisers (e.g. through a double-door autoclave or depyrogenation oven/tunnel) sealed into the wall. Where sterilisation upon transfer of the items is not possible, a procedure which achieves the same objective of not introducing contamination should be validated and implemented, (e.g. using an effective transfer disinfection process, rapid transfer systems for isolators or, for gaseous or liquid materials, a bacteriaretentive filter). The removal of items from the grade A and B areas (e.g. materials, waste, environmental samples) should be carried out via a separate unidirectional process. If this is not possible, time-based separation of movement (incoming/exiting material) by procedure should be considered and controls applied to avoid potential contamination of incoming items.

        text: 'Airlocks should be designed and used to provide physical separation and to minimize microbial and particle contamination of the different areas and should be present for material and personnel moving between different grades. Wherever possible, airlocks used for personnel movement should be separated from those used for material movement. Where this is not practical, time-based separation of movement (personnel/material) by procedure should be considered. Airlocks should be flushed effectively with filtered air to ensure that the grade of the cleanroom is maintained. The final stage of the airlock should, in the “at rest” state, be of the same cleanliness grade (viable and total particle) as the cleanroom into which it leads. The use of separate change rooms for entering and leaving the grade B area is desirable. Where this is not practical, time-based separation of activities (ingress/egress) by procedure should be considered.


          Where the CCS indicates that the risk of contamination is high, separate change rooms for entering and leaving production areas should be used. Airlocks should be designed as follows:'

Adjacent rooms of different grades should have an air pressure difference of a minimum of 10 Pascals (guidance value). Particular attention should be paid to the protection of the critical zone. The recommendations regarding air supplies and pressures may need to be modified where it is necessary to contain certain materials (e.g. pathogenic, highly toxic or radioactive products or live viral or bacterial materials). The modification may include positively or negatively pressurized airlocks that prevent the hazardous material from contaminating surrounding areas. Decontamination of facilities (e.g. the cleanrooms and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems) and the treatment of air leaving a clean area, may be necessary for some operations. Where containment requires air to flow into a critical zone, the source of the air should

        text: Airflow patterns within cleanrooms and zones should be visualised to demonstrate that there is no ingress from lower grade to higher grade areas and that air does not travel from less clean areas (such as the floor) or over operators or equipment that may transfer contamination to the higher-grade areas. Where unidirectional airflow is required, visualisation studies should be performed to determine compliance, (see paragraphs 4.4 & 4.19). When filled, closed products are transferred to an adjacent cleanroom of a lower grade via a small egress point, airflow visualization studies should demonstrate that air does not ingress from the lower grade cleanrooms to the grade B area. Where air movement is shown to be a contamination risk to the clean area or critical zone, corrective actions, such as design improvement, should be implemented. Airflow pattern studies should be performed both at rest and in operation (e.g. simulating operator interventions). Video recordings of the airflow patterns should be retained. The outcome of the air visualisation studies should be documented and considered when establishing the facility's environmental monitoring programme.

A warning system should be in place to instantly indicate and warn operators of any failure in the air supply or reduction of air pressure differences (below set limits for those identified as critical). The warning signal should not be overridden without assessment and a procedure should be available to outline the steps to be taken when a warning signal is given.

Evidence should also be available to demonstrate that the cleaning and bio-decontamination agents used do not have adverse impact on the product produced within the RABS or isolator.

        text: The disinfection of cleanrooms is particularly important. They should be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly in accordance with a written programme. For disinfection to be effective, prior cleaning to remove surface contamination should be performed. Cleaning programmes should effectively remove disinfectant residues. More than one type of disinfecting agent should be employed to ensure that where they have different modes of action, their combined usage is effective against bacteria and fungi. Disinfection should include the periodic use of a sporicidal agent. Monitoring should be undertaken regularly in order to assess the effectiveness of the disinfection programme and to detect changes in types of microbial flora (e.g. organisms resistant to the disinfection regime currently in use).

Disinfectants used in grade C and D may also be required to be sterile where determined in the CCS. Where the disinfectants and detergents are diluted / prepared by the sterile product manufacturer, this should be done in a manner to prevent contamination and they should be monitored for microbial contamination. Dilutions should be kept in previously cleaned containers (and sterilized where applicable) and should only be stored for the defined period. If the disinfectants and detergents are supplied “ready-made” then results from certificates of analysis or conformance can be accepted subject to successful completion of the appropriate vendor qualification.

Alert levels should be based on the initial qualification data and thereafter periodically reassessed on data obtained during subsequent re-qualifications, routine monitoring, and investigations. Review of ongoing monitoring data should be carried out to identify any adverse trend in system performance. Sampling programmes should reflect the requirements of the CCS and should include all outlets and points of use, at a specified interval, to ensure that representative water samples are obtained for analysis on a regular basis. Sample plans should be based on the qualification data, should consider the potential worst case sampling locations and should ensure that at least one representative sample is included every day of the water that is used for manufacturing processes.

For a generator supplying pure steam used for the direct sterilisation of materials or product-contact surfaces (e.g. porous / hard-good autoclave loads), steam condensate should meet the current monograph for WFI of the relevant Pharmacopeia (microbial testing is not mandatory for steam condensate). A suitable sampling schedule should be in place to ensure that representative pure steam is obtained for analysis on a regular basis. Other aspects of the quality of pure steam used for sterilisation should be assessed periodically against validated parameters. These parameters should include the following (unless otherwise justified): non-condensable gases, dryness value

        text: High standards of personal hygiene and cleanliness are essential to prevent excessive shedding or increased risk of introduction of microbial contamination. Personnel involved in the manufacture of sterile products should be instructed to report any specific health conditions or ailments which may cause the shedding of abnormal numbers or types of contaminants and therefore preclude cleanroom access. Health conditions and actions to be taken with regard to personnel who could be introducing an undue microbial hazard should be provided by the designated competent person and described in procedures.

        text: Activities in clean areas that are not critical to the production processes should be kept to a minimum, especially when aseptic operations are in progress. Movement of personnel should be slow, controlled and methodical to avoid excessive shedding of particles and organisms due to over-vigorous activity. Operators performing aseptic operations should adhere to aseptic technique at all times to prevent changes in air currents that may introduce air of lower quality into the critical zone. Movement adjacent to the critical zone should be restricted and the obstruction of the path of the unidirectional (first air) airflow should be avoided. A review of airflow visualisation studies should be considered as part of the training programme.

        text: Preparation of components and materials should be performed in at least a grade D cleanroom in order to limit the risk of microbial, endotoxin/pyrogen and particle contamination, so that the product is suitable for sterilisation. Where the product is at a high or unusual risk of microbial contamination (e.g. the product actively supports microbial growth, the product must be held for long periods before filling or the product is not processed mostly in closed vessels), then preparation should be carried out in at least a grade C environment. Preparation of ointments, creams, suspensions and emulsions should be carried out in at least a grade C environment before terminal sterilisation. Specific guidance regarding terminally sterilised veterinary medicinal products can be found within Annex 4 of the GMP Guide.

Where the latter approach is adopted, vials should be protected by grade A conditions up to the point of leaving the aseptic processing area, and thereafter stoppered vials should be protected with a grade A air supply until the cap has been crimped. The supporting background environment of grade A air supply should meet at least grade D requirements. Where capping is a manual process, it should be performed under grade A conditions either in an appropriately designed isolator or in grade A with a grade B background.

A sterilising grade filter that is used to sterilise a fluid should be subject to a non-destructive integrity test post-use prior to removal of the filter from its housing. The integrity test process should be validated and test results should correlate to the microbial retention capability of the filter established during validation. Examples of tests that are used include bubble point, diffusive flow, water intrusion or pressure hold test. It is recognized that PUPSIT may not always be possible after sterilisation due to process constraints (e.g. the filtration of very small volumes of solution). In these cases, an alternative approach may be taken providing that a thorough risk assessment has been performed and compliance is achieved by the implementation of appropriate controls to mitigate any risk of a non-integral filtration system. Points to consider in such a risk assessment should include but are not limited to:'

However, in the event of a failure of the post-use integrity test on the primary filter, post-use integrity test on the secondary (redundant) filter should be performed, in conjunction with an investigation and risk assessment to determine the reason for the primary filter test failure.

        text: Due to the generation of particles from polymer extrusion and cutting during operation, and the restrictive size of critical filling zones of BFS equipment, in operation monitoring of total particle for BFS equipment is not expected. However, data should be available to demonstrate that the design of the equipment ensures that critical zones of the filling process environment would meet grade A conditions in operation.

        text: 'The background environment in which closed systems are located should be based on their design and the processes undertaken. For aseptic processing and where there are any risks that system integrity may be compromised, the system should be located in grade A. If the system can be shown to remain integral at every usage (e.g. via pressure testing and/or monitoring) then a lower classified area may be used. Any transfer between classified areas should be thoroughly assessed (see paragraph 4.10). If the closed system is opened (e.g. for maintenance of a bulk manufacturing line) then this should be performed in a classified area appropriate to the materials (e.g. grade C for terminal sterilisation processes, or grade A for aseptic processing) or be subject to further cleaning and disinfection (and sterilisation in case of aseptic processes).

An assessment should be carried out for each component to evaluate the applicability of the extractable profile data. For components considered to be at high risk from leachables, including those that may absorb processed materials or those with extended material contact times, an assessment of leachable profile studies, including safety concerns, should be taken into consideration. If applying simulated processing conditions, these should accurately reflect the actual processing conditions and be based on a scientific rationale.

Attention to the structural integrity of the single use components is necessary where these may be exposed to more extreme conditions (e.g. freezing and thawing processes) either during routine processing or transportation. This should include verification that intrinsic sterile connection devices (both heat sealed and mechanically sealed) remain integral under these conditions.

It should be noted that the reliability of each of the elements of the monitoring system (viable, non-viable and APS) when taken in isolation is limited and should not be considered individually to be an indicator of asepsis. When considered together, the results help confirm the reliability of the design, validation and operation of the system that they are monitoring.

        text: The grade A area should be monitored continuously (for particles ≥0.5 and ≥5 µm) and with a suitable sample flow rate (at least 28 litres (1ft 3) per minute) so that all interventions, transient events and any system deterioration is captured. The system should frequently correlate each individual sample result with alert levels and action limits at such a frequency that any potential excursion can be identified and responded to in a timely manner. Alarms should be triggered if alert levels are exceeded. Procedures should define the actions to be taken in response to alarms including the consideration of additional microbial monitoring.

The method of sampling used should be justified within the CCS and should be demonstrated not to have a detrimental impact on grade A and B airflow patterns. Cleanroom and equipment surfaces should be monitored at the end of an operation.

In case of an incident, additional sample locations may be used as a verification of the effectiveness of a corrective action (e.g. cleaning and disinfection).

Monitoring should include sampling of personnel at periodic intervals during the process. Sampling of personnel should be performed in such a way that it will not compromise the process. Particular consideration should be given to monitoring personnel following involvement in critical interventions (at a minimum gloves, but may require monitoring of areas of gown as applicable to the process) and on each exit from the grade B cleanroom (gloves and gown). Where monitoring of gloves is performed after critical interventions, the outer gloves should be replaced prior to continuation of activity. Where monitoring of gowns is required after critical interventions, the gown should be replaced before further activity in the cleanroom.

        text: Periodic verification of the effectiveness of the controls in place for aseptic processing should include an APS using a sterile nutrient media and/or surrogate in place of the product. The APS should not be considered as the primary means to validate the aseptic process or aspects of the aseptic process. The effectiveness of the aseptic process should be determined through process design, adherence to the pharmaceutical quality system and process controls, training, and evaluation of monitoring data. Selection of an appropriate nutrient media and/or surrogate should be made based on the ability of the media and/or surrogate to imitate physical product characteristics assessed to pose a risk to product sterility during the aseptic process. Where processing stages may indirectly impact the viability of any introduced microbial contamination, (e.g. aseptically produced semi-solids, powders, solid materials, microspheres, liposomes and other formulations where product is cooled or heated or lyophilized), alternative procedures that represent the operations as closely as possible should be developed. Where surrogate materials, such as buffers, are used in parts of the APS, the surrogate material should not inhibit the growth of any potential contamination.

        text: APS should be performed as part of the initial validation, with at least three consecutive satisfactory simulation tests that cover all working shifts that the aseptic process may occur in, and after any significant modification to operational practices, facilities, services or equipment which are assessed to have an impact on the sterility assurance of the product (e.g. modification to the HVAC system, equipment, changes to process, number of shifts and numbers of personnel, major facility shut down). Normally, APS (periodic revalidation) should be repeated twice a year (approximately every six months) for each aseptic process, each filling line and each shift. Each operator should participate in at least one successful APS annually. Consideration should be given to performing an APS after the last batch prior to shut down, before long periods of inactivity or before decommissioning or relocation of a line.

        text: Filled APS units should be agitated, swirled or inverted before incubation to ensure contact of the media with all interior surfaces in the container. All integral units from the APS should be incubated and evaluated, including units with cosmetic defects or those which have gone through non-destructive in-process control checks. If units are discarded during the process simulation and not incubated, these should be comparable with units discarded during a routine fill, and only if production SOPs clearly specify that units must be removed under the same circumstances (i.e. type of intervention; line location; specific number of units removed). In no case should more units be removed during a media fill intervention than would be cleared during a production run. Examples may include those that must be discarded during routine production after the set-up process or following a specific type of intervention. To fully understand the process and assess contamination risks during aseptic setup or mandatory line clearances, these units would typically be incubated separately, and would not necessarily be included in the acceptance criteria for the APS.

Where the product container is not clear (e.g. amber glass, opaque plastic), clear containers of identical configuration may be substituted to aid in the detection of contamination. When a clear container of identical configuration cannot be substituted, a suitable method for the detection of microbial growth should be developed and validated. Microorganisms isolated from contaminated units should be identified to the species level when practical, to assist in the determination of the likely source of the contaminant.

        text: For some products it may not be possible to obtain a sterility test result prior to release because the shelf life of the product is too short to allow completion of a sterility test. In these cases, the additional considerations of design of the process and additional monitoring and/or alternative test methods required to mitigate the identified risks should be assessed and documented.

        text: Media used for product testing should be quality control tested according to the related Pharmacopeia before use. Media used for environmental monitoring and APS should be tested for growth promotion before use, using a scientifically justified and designated group of reference microorganisms and including suitably representative local isolates. Media quality control testing should normally be performed by the end user. Any reliance on outsourced testing or supplier testing of media should be justified and transportation and shipping conditions should be thoroughly considered in this case.

        text: 'Where rapid and automated microbial methods are used for general manufacturing purposes, these methods should be validated for the product(s) or processes concerned.


          Glossary Airlock – An enclosed space with interlocked doors, constructed to maintain air pressure control between adjoining rooms (generally with different air cleanliness standards). The intent of an airlock is to preclude ingress of particle matter and microorganism contamination from a lesser controlled area.


          Action limit – An established relevant measure (e.g. microbial, or airborne particle limits) that, when exceeded, should trigger appropriate investigation and corrective action based on the investigation.


          Alert level – An established relevant measure (e.g. microbial, or airborne particle levels) giving early warning of potential drift from normal operating conditions and validated state, which does not necessarily give grounds for corrective action but triggers appropriate scrutiny and follow-up to address the potential problem. Alert levels are established based on routine and qualification trend data and are periodically reviewed. The alert level can be based on a number of parameters including adverse trends, individual excursions above a set limit and repeat events.


          Aseptic preparation/processing – The handling of sterile product, containers and/or devices in a controlled environment in which the air supply, materials and personnel are regulated to prevent microbial, endotoxin/pyrogen and particle contamination.


          Aseptic Process Simulation (APS) – A simulation of the entire aseptic manufacturing process in order to verify the capability of the process to assure product sterility. Includes all aseptic operations associated with routine manufacturing, e.g. equipment assembly, formulation, filling, lyophilization and sealing processes as necessary.


          Asepsis – A state of control attained by using an aseptic work area and performing activities in a manner that precludes microbial contamination of the exposed sterile product.


          Bacterial retention testing – This test is performed to validate that a filter can remove bacteria from a gas or liquid. The test is usually performed using a standard organism, such as Brevundimonas diminuta at a minimum concentration of 107 Colony Forming Units/cm2.


          Barrier – A physical partition that affords aseptic processing area (usually grade A) protection by separating it from the background environment. Such systems frequently use in part or totally the Barrier Technologies known as RABS or isolators.


          Bioburden – The total number of microorganisms associated with a specific item such as personnel, manufacturing environments (air and surfaces), equipment, product packaging, raw materials (including water), in-process materials, or finished products.


          Bio-decontamination - A process that eliminates viable bioburden via use of sporicidal chemical agents.


          Biological Indicators (BI) – A population of microorganisms inoculated onto a suitable medium (e.g. solution, container or closure) and placed within a steriliser or load or room locations to determine the sterilisation or disinfection cycle efficacy of a physical or chemical process. The challenge microorganism is selected and validated based upon its resistance to the given process. Incoming lot D-value, microbiological count and purity define the quality of the BI.


          Blow-Fill-Seal (BFS) – A technology in which containers are formed from a thermoplastic granulate, filled with product, and then sealed in a continuous, integrated, automatic operation. The two most common types of BFS machines are the Shuttle type (with Parison cut) and the Rotary type (Closed Parison).


          Campaign manufacture – A manufacture of a series of batches of the same product in sequence in a given period of time with strict adherence to established and validated control measures.


          Classified area – An area that contains a number of cleanrooms (see cleanroom definition).


          Cleaning – A process for removing contamination e.g. product residues or disinfectant residues.


          Clean area – An area with defined particle and microbiological cleanliness standards usually containing a number of joined cleanrooms.


          Cleanroom – A room designed, maintained, and controlled to prevent particle and microbial contamination of drug products. Such a room is assigned and reproducibly meets an appropriate air cleanliness level.


          Cleanroom classification – A method of assessing the level of air cleanliness against a specification for a cleanroom or clean air equipment by measuring the total particle concentration.


          Cleanroom qualification – A method of assessing the level of compliance of a classified cleanroom or clean air equipment with its intended use.


          Closed system – A system in which the product is not exposed to the surrounding environment. For example, this can be achieved by the use of bulk product holders (such as tanks or bags) that are connected to each other by pipes or tubes as a system, and where used for sterile products, the full system is sterilised after the connections are made. Examples of these can be (but are not limited to) large scale reusable systems, such as those seen in active substance manufacturing, or disposable bag and manifold systems, such as those seen in the manufacture of biological products. Closed systems are not opened until the conclusion of an operation. The use of the term “closed systems” in this Annex does not refer to systems such as RABS or isolator systems.


          Colony Forming Unit (CFU) – A microbiological term that describes a single detectable colony that originates from one or more microorganisms. Colony forming units are typically expressed as CFU per ml for liquid samples, CFU per m3 for air sample and CFU per sample for samples captured on solid medium such as settle or contact plates.


          Contamination – The undesired introduction of impurities of a microbiological nature (quantity and type of microorganisms, pyrogen), or of foreign particle matter, into or onto a raw material, intermediate, active substance or drug product during production, sampling, packaging or repackaging, storage or transport with the potential to adversely impact product quality.


          Contamination Control Strategy (CCS) – A planned set of controls for microorganisms, endotoxin/pyrogen and particles, derived from current product and process understanding that assures process performance and product quality. The controls can include parameters and attributes related to active substance, excipient and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control.


          Corrective intervention – An intervention that is performed to correct or adjust an aseptic process during its execution. These may not occur at a set frequency in the routine aseptic process. Examples include such as clearing component jams, stopping leaks, adjusting sensors, and replacing equipment components.


          Critical surfaces – Surfaces that may come directly into contact with, or directly affect, a sterile product or its containers or closures. Critical surfaces are rendered sterile prior to the start of the manufacturing operation, and sterility is maintained throughout processing.


          Critical zone – A location within the aseptic processing area in which product and critical surfaces are exposed to the environment.


          Critical intervention – An intervention (corrective or inherent) into the critical zone.


          D-value – The value of a parameter of sterilisation (duration or absorbed dose) required to reduce the number of viable organisms to 10 per cent of the original number.


          Dead leg – Length of non-circulating pipe (where fluid may remain static) that is greater than 3 internal pipe diameters.


          Decommission – When a process, equipment or cleanroom are closed and they will not be used again.


          Decontamination – The overall process of removal or reduction of any contaminants (chemical, waste, residue or microorganisms) from an area, object, or person. The method of decontamination used (e.g. cleaning, disinfection, sterilisation) should be chosen and validated to achieve a level of cleanliness appropriate to the intended use of the item decontaminated. See also Bio-decontamination.


          Depyrogenation – A process designed to remove or inactivate pyrogenic material (e.g. endotoxin) to a specified minimum quantity.


          Disinfection – The process by which the reduction of the number of microorganisms is achieved by the irreversible action of a product on their structure or metabolism, to a level deemed to be appropriate for a defined purpose.


          Endotoxin – A pyrogenic product (i.e. lipopolysaccharide) present in the Gram negative bacterial cell wall. Endotoxin can lead to reactions in patients receiving injections ranging from fever to death.


          Equilibration time – Period which elapses between the attainment of the sterilisation temperature at the reference measurement point and the attainment of the sterilisation temperature at all points within the load.


          Extractables - Chemical entities that migrate from the surface of the process equipment, exposed to an appropriate solvent at extreme conditions, into the product or material being processed.


          First Air – Refers to filtered air that has not been interrupted prior to contacting exposed product and product contact surfaces with the potential to add contamination to the air prior to reaching the critical zone.


          Filter Integrity test - A test to confirm that a filter (product, gas or HVAC filter) retain their retentive properties and have not been damaged during handling, installation or processing.


          Form-Fill-Seal (FFS) –An automated filling process, typically used for terminally sterilised products, which constructs the primary container out of a continuous flat roll of packaging film while simultaneously filling the formed container with product and sealing the filled containers in a continuous process. FFS processes may utilize a single web system (where a single flat roll of film is wrapped around itself to form a cavity), or a dual web system (where two flat rolls of film are brought together to form a cavity), often with the aid of vacuum moulds or pressurised gases. The formed cavity is filled, sealed and cut into sections. Films typically consist of a polymeric material, polymeric coated foil or other suitable material.


          Gowning qualification – A programme that establishes, both initially and on a periodic basis, the capability of an individual to don the complete gown.


          Grade A air supply – Air which is passed through a filter qualified as capable of producing grade A total particle quality air, but where there is no requirement to perform continuous total particle monitoring or meet grade A viable monitoring limits. Specifically used for the protection of fully stoppered vials where the cap has not yet been crimped.


          HEPA filter – High efficiency particulate air filter specified in accordance with a relevant international standard.


          Inherent interventions – An intervention that is an integral part of the aseptic process and is required for either set-up, routine operation and/or monitoring (e.g. aseptic assembly, container replenishment, environmental sampling). Inherent interventions are required by procedure or work instruction for the execution of the aseptic process.


          Intrinsic sterile connection device – A device that reduces the risk of contamination during the connection process; these can be mechanical or fusion sealing.


          Isokinetic sampling head – A sampling head designed to disturb the air as little as possible so that the same particles go into the nozzle as would have passed the area if the nozzle had not been there (i.e. the sampling condition in which the mean velocity of the air entering the sample probe inlet is nearly the same (± 20 percent) as the mean velocity of the airflow at that location).


          Isolator – An enclosure capable of being subject to reproducible interior bio-decontamination, with an internal work zone meeting grade A conditions that provides uncompromised, continuous isolation of its interior from the external environment (e.g. surrounding cleanroom air and personnel). There are two major types of isolators:'

          text: "Open isolator systems are designed to allow for the continuous or semi-continuous ingress and/or egress of materials during operations through one\n             or more openings. Openings are engineered (e.g. using continuous\n             overpressure) to exclude the entry of external contaminant into the isolator.\nLeachables – Chemical entities that migrate into products from the product contact surface of the process equipment or containers under normal condition of use and/or storage.\n\nLocal isolates – Suitably representative microorganisms of the site that are frequently recovered through environmental monitoring within the classified zone/areas especially grade A and B areas, personnel monitoring or positive sterility test results.\n\nLyophilization – A physical-chemical drying process designed to remove solvents, by way of sublimation, from both aqueous and non-aqueous systems, primarily to achieve product or material stability. Lyophilization is synonymous to the term freeze-drying.\n\nManual aseptic processing– An aseptic process where the operator manually compounds, fills, places and /or seals an open container with sterile product.\n\nOperator - Any individual participating in the processing operation, including line set-up, filling, maintenance, or other personnel associated with manufacturing activities.\n\nOverkill sterilisation – A process that is sufficient to provide at least a 12 log 10 reduction of microorganisms having a minimum D-value of 1 minute.\n\nParison – The \"tube\" of polymer extruded by the BFS machine from which containers are formed.\n\nPass-through hatch – Synonymous with airlock (see airlock definition) but typically smaller in size.\n\nPatient – Human or animal including participants in a clinical trial.\n\nPost-aseptic processing terminal heat treatment– A terminal moist heat process employed after aseptic processing which has been demonstrated to provide a sterility assurance level (SAL) ≤10-6 but where the requirements of steam sterilisation (for\n\nexample, F0≥8 min) are not fulfilled. This may also be beneficial in the destruction of viruses that may not be removed through filtration.\n\nPyrogen – A substance that induces a febrile reaction in patients receiving injections;\n\nRapid Transfer System/Port (RTP) – A System used for the transfer of items into RABS or isolators that minimizes the risk to the critical zone. An example would be a rapid transfer container with an alpha/beta port.\n\nRaw material – Any ingredient intended for use in the manufacture of a sterile product, including those that may not appear in the final drug product.\n\nRestricted Access Barrier System (RABS) – System that provides an enclosed, but not fully sealed, environment meeting defined air quality conditions (for aseptic processing grade A), and using a rigid-wall enclosure and integrated gloves to separate its interior from the surrounding cleanroom environment. The inner surfaces of the RABS are disinfected and decontaminated with a sporicidal agent. Operators use gloves, half suits, RTPs and other integrated transfer ports to perform manipulations or convey materials to the interior of the RABS. Depending on the design, doors are rarely opened, and only under strictly pre-defined conditions.\n\nSingle Use Systems (SUS) – Systems in which product contact components are used only once to replace reusable equipment such as stainless steel transfer lines or bulk containers. SUS covered in this document are those that are used in manufacturing processes of sterile products and are typically made up of disposable components such as bags, filters, tubing, connectors, storage bottles and sensors.\n\nSporicidal agent – An agent that destroys bacterial and fungal spores when used in sufficient concentration for specified contact time. It is expected to kill all vegetative microorganisms.\n\nSterile Product – For purpose of this guidance, sterile product refers to one or more of the sterilised elements exposed to aseptic conditions and ultimately making up the sterile active substance or finished sterile product. These elements include the containers, closures, and components of the finished drug product. Or, a product that is rendered sterile by a terminal sterilisation process.\n\nSterilising grade filter – A filter that, when appropriately validated, will remove a defined microbial challenge from a fluid or gas producing a sterile effluent. Usually such filters have a pore size equal or less than 0.22 µm.\n\nTerminal Sterilisation – The application of a lethal sterilising agent or conditions to a product in its final container to achieve a predetermined sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10⁻⁶ or better (e.g. the theoretical probability of there being a single viable microorganism present on or in a sterilised unit is equal to or less than 1 x 10-6 (one in a million)).\n\nTurbulent airflow – Air that is not unidirectional. Turbulent air in cleanrooms should flush the cleanroom via mixed flow dilution and ensure maintenance of acceptable air quality.\n\nUnidirectional airflow – An airflow moving in a single direction, in a robust and uniform manner, and at sufficient speed, to reproducibly sweep particles away from the critical processing or testing area.\n\nUnidirectional Airflow (UDAF) unit – A cabinet supplied with filtered unidirectional airflow (previously referred to as a Laminar Airflow Unit or LAF).\n\nWorst case – A set of conditions encompassing processing limits and circumstances, including those within standard operating procedures, that pose the greatest chance of process or product failure (when compared with ideal conditions). Such conditions have the highest potential to, but do not necessarily always result in product or process failure.\n\nWater system – A system for producing, storing and distributing water, usually compliant to a specific pharmacopeia grade (e.g. purified water and water for injection (WFI)).\n\nZ-value – The temperature difference that leads to a 10-fold change in the D-value of the biological indicators.\n\nAnnex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use"

      text: 'The methods employed in the manufacture of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) are a critical factor in shaping the appropriate regulatory control. ATMPs can be defined therefore largely by reference to their method of manufacture. For example, for gene therapy ATMPs, genetic modifications can be obtained through a variety of methods (e.g. viral & non-viral vectors, mRNA, ex vivo and in vivo genome-editing tools). The genetically modified cells can be of human origin (autologous or allogeneic) or of animal origin (xenogeneic cells), either primary or established cell lines. In a medicinal product, the genetically modified cells or gene therapy products can be presented alone or combined with medical devices.


        This annex provides additional and specific guidance on the full range of ATMPs (as defined in the glossary) and the active substances that are used in their manufacture. This annex applies both to investigational ATMPs and marketauthorised ATMPs. It can also be applied to ATMP manufacturing in hospital settings and for compassionate use programs, where authorised by national law.


        Although one of the objectives of this present annex was to prepare a document that would stand for several years, the field is quickly changing. It is recognised that amendments may be necessary to accommodate technological change, to clarify uncertainty or to specifically recognise important alternatives. Comments are therefore invited at any stage of the life of this edition.


        This annex is divided into two main parts:'

      text: 'This annex, along with several other annexes of the Guide to GMP, provides guidance, which supplements that in Part I: Basic Requirements for Medicinal Products and in Part II: Basic Requirements for active pharmaceutical ingredients of the PIC/S GMP Guide.

        Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use


        however been written in a manner that it could enable development of a standalone guide if integrated with PIC/S GMP Part I, Part II, and related annexes.


        Where due to the nature of the product or technical necessities, specific guidance is provided in this annex, compliance with this annex is expected and takes precedence over other sections in the PIC/S GMP Guide unless there are good reasons for not doing so with documented sound scientific rationale applied using QRM principles.

        text: "For blood or blood components used as starting materials for ATMPs, national legislation may provide the technical requirements for the selection of donors and the collection and testing of blood and blood components.\n\nThe manufacturing process for ATMPs is product-specific and different design approaches are possible. The appropriate application of GMP should be described, justified in the Clinical Trial Application (CTA) or Marketing Authorisation (MA), and in accordance with national law. Consideration may be given to defining which manufacturing process steps are required to manufacture starting materials, ATMP active substance, or the finished ATMP. In some cases, the manufacturing process between the ATMP active substance and the final product can be defined as continuous.\n\nThe manufacture and control of genetically modified organisms also needs to comply with other local, national or regional requirements. Appropriate containment should be established and maintained in facilities where any genetically modified organism is handled. Advice should be obtained according to national law in order to establish and maintain the appropriate Biological Safety Level. GMP should be adhered alongside these requirements.\n\nTable 1 gives examples of where this annex applies. It should be noted that this table is illustrative only and is not meant to describe the precise scope. It should also be understood that adherence to the GMP or GMP principles for the manufacturing steps indicated in the corresponding table is dependent on applicable national legislation. The level of GMP requirements increases from early to later steps in the manufacture of ATMP active substances. The inclusion of some early steps of manufacture within the scope of this annex does not imply that those steps will be routinely subject to inspection by the authorities. According to national legislation more or less stringent approaches on the application of GMP on those early stages may apply.\n             Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use\nTable 1.

      text: 'The manufacture of ATMPs involves certain specific considerations arising from the nature of the products and the processes. The ways in which biological medicinal products are manufactured, controlled and administered make some particular precautions necessary.


        Since materials and processing conditions used in manufacturing processes are designed to provide conditions for the growth of specific cells and microorganisms, this provides an opportunity for extraneous microbial contaminants (e.g. bacteria, fungi) to grow. In addition, some products may be limited in their ability to withstand a wide range of purification techniques, particularly those designed to inactivate or remove adventitious viral


        Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use


        contaminants. The design of the processes, equipment, facilities, utilities, the conditions of preparation and addition of buffers and reagents, sampling and training of the operators are key considerations to minimise such contamination events (i.e. engineering and technical controls). In addition, manufacturing processes need to be well designed and controlled so as not to add further variability to the product.


        Product specifications such as those in pharmacopoeial monographs, CTA, and MA will dictate whether and to what manufacturing stage substances and materials can have a defined level of bioburden or need to be sterile. Similarly, manufacturing must be consistent with other specifications set out in the CTA or MA (e.g. number of generations (doublings, passages) between the seed lot or cell bank).


        For biological materials that cannot be sterilized (e.g. by filtration), processing must be conducted aseptically to minimise the introduction of contaminants. Where they exist, other guidance documents should be consulted on the validation of specific manufacturing methods (e.g. virus removal or inactivation). The application of appropriate environmental controls and monitoring and, wherever feasible, in-situ cleaning and sterilisation systems together with the use of closed systems and sterile disposable product-contact equipment can significantly reduce the risk of accidental contamination and cross-contamination.


        ATMPs require a combination of unique biological methods and standard physico-chemical assays for their Quality Control (QC). For many cell-based products, there is variability introduced through the starting materials that cannot be overcome by the manufacturing process or In-Process Controls (IPCs). Adequate control of the starting and raw materials, well defined characterisation of the ATMP active substance and ATMP drug product release testing form the crucial part of the QC. Controls should take into consideration the intrinsic variability of the biological material needed for ATMP manufacturing. A robust manufacturing process is therefore crucial and in-process controls take on a particular importance in the manufacture of biological active substances and medicinal products.'

          text: GMP applies to the lifecycle stages from the manufacture of investigational ATMP, technology transfer, and commercial manufacturing through to product discontinuation. The biological processes may display inherent variability, so that the range and nature of by-products may be variable. As a result, Quality Risk Management (QRM) principles as detailed in Annex 20 are particularly important for this class of medicinal products and should be used to develop their control strategy across all stages of development and manufacturing steps to minimise variability and to reduce the opportunity for contamination and cross-contamination.

The measures to prevent cross-contamination should be commensurate with the risks to product quality. QRM principles should be used to assess and control the risks.


            Depending on the level of risk presented by some ATMPs and the materials involved in their production (for example, viruses), it may be necessary to dedicate premises and equipment for manufacturing and/or packaging operations to control the risk. Segregated production areas should be used for the manufacture of ATMPs presenting a risk that cannot be adequately controlled by operational and/or technical measures.

Where negative pressure areas or BSCs are used for aseptic processing of materials with particular risks (e.g. pathogens), they should be surrounded by a positive pressure clean zone of appropriate Grade. These pressure cascades should be clearly defined and continuously monitored with appropriate alarm settings as defined by Annex 1. The design of such areas should be such that measures put in place to prevent release of material into the surrounding environment should not compromise sterility assurance level (SAL) of the product and vice versa.

If pressure monitoring or integrity testing is technically not feasible for the filter system, vendor supplied information may be considered for approval. However, this has to be taken into account in the CCS as an additional risk factor especially for short shelf life ATMPs, where microbiological quality tests are not available at the time of batch release prior to medical product administration.

          text: Where processes are not closed and there is exposure of the product to the immediate room environment without a subsequent microbial inactivation process, (e.g. during additions of supplements, media, buffers, gasses, manipulations) appropriate environmental conditions should be applied. For aseptic manipulations parameters in line with Annex 1 (i.e. Grade A with Grade B background) should be applied. The environmental monitoring program should include testing and monitoring of non-viable contamination, viable contamination and air pressure differentials. The monitoring locations should be determined having regards to the QRM principles. The number of samples, volume, and frequency of monitoring, alert and action limits should be appropriate taking into account the QRM principles. Sampling methods should not pose a risk of contamination to the manufacturing operations. Where appropriate control is required in the process, temperature and relative humidity should be monitored. All environmental monitoring results should be trended.

However, this option should be considered exceptional and applicable only if the product is intended to treat a life-threatening condition where no alternative therapeutic options exist. The environment must be specified and justified to provide patient benefit that outweighs the significant risk created by manufacturing under less stringent environments. If the Competent Authority grants an approval, the manufacturer must pursue establishing the appropriate environment as improvements in the technology occur.

Where the relocation of equipment is unavoidable, after reviewing engineering and/ or technical modifications, the risk should be assessed in line with QRM principles, mitigated and monitored to ensure an effective cross-contamination control strategy (refer to Section 3.4 CCS).

          text: If closed systems are used for the production of ATMPs, checks should be carried out to ensure that all pieces of the equipment are connected in a correct manner to assure the closed state. Special attention should be given to apply these tests to automated systems. If feasible and based on QRM principles, for example considering testing carried out by vendors, the integrity of single use systems should be verified at adequate frequency prior to use and potentially post use, possibly automatically. The integrity of reused equipment should be verified before use after cleaning and sterilisation.

The re-use of the same matrix at different stages of processing is discouraged due to risk of carryover contamination. Any such re-usage should be supported by appropriate validation data. Acceptance criteria, operating conditions, regeneration methods, life span, and sanitization or sterilisation methods of chromatography columns should be defined.

            text: For all aseptic processes, aseptic process simulations should be performed as part of initial validation and repeated thereafter every six months in line with Annex 1. In the case of infrequent production (i.e. if the interval between the production of two batches is more than six months but less than a year), it is acceptable that the process simulation test is done prior to manufacturing of the next batch. This is provided that, the results of the process simulation test are available prior to the starting of production. Any deviation from this approach needs to be thoroughly justified by QRM principles considering all aspects of product nature, product quality and patient safety.

In contrast with the two-tiered system of Master and Working cell banks, the number of production runs from a cell stock is limited by the number of aliquots obtained after expansion and does not cover the entire life cycle of the product. Cell stock changes should be addressed in the MA/CTA and thereby covered by a validation and comparability protocol, as the inter-donor variability may change the product.

          text: Samples of the starting materials should generally be kept for two years after the batch release. However, it is acknowledged that the retention of samples may be challenging due to scarcity of the materials. Due to this intrinsic limitation, it is justified not to keep reference samples of the cells/tissues used as starting materials in the case of autologous ATMPs and certain allogeneic ATMPs (i.e. matched donor scenario). In other cases, where the scarcity of the materials is also a concern, the sampling strategy may be adapted based on risk assessment and appropriately implemented mitigation measures. For cases where the starting material is an established cell bank system, there is no need to keep cell bank vials specifically for the purpose of reference samples.

          text: 'Shorter retention periods as mentioned in Section 6.6 and 6.7 might be justified based on the stability and shelf life of the product. In cases of short shelf life, the manufacturer should consider if the retention of the sample under conditions that prolong the shelf life (such as cryopreservation) is representative for the intended purpose. For instance, cryopreservation of fresh-cells may render the sample inadequate for characterisation purposes but the sample may be adequate for sterility or viral safety controls (the volume of the samples can be reduced according to the intended purpose). When cryostorage of a sample is considered inadequate for the intended purpose, the manufacturer should consider alternative approaches that are scientifically justified.

          text: In the exceptional circumstances where approved by the Competent Authority and in accordance with CTA or MA or other national requirements, manufacturing of the ATMP may take place in sites close to the patient (e.g. ATMPs with short shelf life, clinical advantage of using fresh cells as opposed to freezing the starting materials/finished product, advantages of using automated equipment, etc.). This includes manufacturing models where partial manufacturing occurs at a central site and finishing occurs at a local site. It also includes manufacturing models where there are no steps occurring at a central site and the active substance is provided to a number of local sites where full manufacture occurs. In such cases, steps in the manufacturing of the ATMPs may occur in multiple sites that may be also located in treatment centres (point of care) including hospitals. National law might require GMP-manufacturing authorisations and/ or authorisations for the procurement and/or manufacture of blood, cells and tissues intended to be used for ATMP manufacturing at the central site and the satellite sites.

      text: 'B1. ANIMAL SOURCED PRODUCTS


        This guidance applies to animal materials, which includes materials from establishments such as abattoirs. Since the supply chains can be extensive and complex, controls based on QRM principles need to be applied, see also requirements of appropriate pharmacopoeial monographs, including the need for specific tests at defined stages. Documentation to demonstrate the supply chain traceability5 and clear roles of participants in the supply chain, typically including a sufficiently detailed and current process map, should be in place.


        B 1.1 Monitoring programmes should be in place for animal disease that is of concern to human health. Organisations should take into account reports from trustworthy sources on national disease prevalence when compiling their assessment of risk and mitigation factors. Such organisations include the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE, Office International des Epizooties). This should be supplemented by information on health monitoring and control programme(s) at national and local levels, the latter to include the sources (e.g. farm or feedlot) from which the animals are drawn and the control measures in place during transport to the abattoirs.


        B 1.2 Control measures for starting and raw materials at establishments such as abattoirs should include appropriate elements of a Quality Management System to assure a satisfactory level of operator training, materials traceability, control and consistency. These measures may be drawn from sources outside PIC/S GMP but should be shown to provide equivalent levels of control. Xenogeneic starting material should comply with other national laws.


        B 1.3 Control measures for starting or raw materials should be in place, which prevent interventions, which may affect the quality of materials, or which at least provides evidence of such activities, during their progression through the manufacturing and supply chain. This includes the movement of material between sites of initial collection, partial and final purification(s), storage sites, hubs, consolidators and brokers. Details of such arrangements should be recorded within the traceability system and any breaches recorded, investigated and actions taken.


        B 1.4 Regular audits of the starting or raw material supplier should be undertaken which verify compliance with controls for materials at the different stages of manufacture. Issues must be investigated to a depth appropriate to their significance, for which full documentation should be available. Systems should also be in place to ensure that effective corrective and preventive actions are taken.


        B 1.5 Cells, tissues and organs intended for the manufacture of xenogeneic cell based medicinal products should be obtained only from animals that have been bred in captivity (barrier facility) specifically for this purpose and under no circumstances should cells, tissues and organs from wild animals or from abattoirs be used. Tissues of founder animals similarly should not be used. The health status of the animals should be monitored and documented.


        5         See PIC/S GMP Chapter 5

        B2. GENE THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS (GTMPs)


        There are several types of gene therapy products. Synthetic GTMPs are within the scope of the guidance in this section. For cell-based gene therapy products, some aspects of the guidance in Section B3 may also be applicable.'

            Master virus seed (MVS) As above, but in relation to viruses.


            Material directly in contact with the ATMP during manufacture and storage Non exhaustive example list: Processing containers (e.g. fermenters, cell culture flasks and plates, blood bag systems, single use equipment used in automated manufacturing platforms, beads for separation techniques, chromatographic column material), cryocontainers for storage and primary packaging material.


            Monosepsis (axenic) A single organism in culture, which is not contaminated with any other.


            Multi-product facility A facility that manufactures, concurrently or in campaign mode, a range of different ATMPs active substances and products and within which equipment train either may or may not be dedicated to specific substances or products.


            Plasmid A plasmid is a piece of DNA usually present in a bacterial cell as a circular entity separated from the cell chromosome; it can be modified by molecular biology techniques, purified out of the bacterial cell and used to transfer its DNA to another cell.


            Primary cell lot A pool of primary cells minimally expanded to attain a sufficient number for a limited number of applications.


            Principles of GMP: The Annex 2A in conjunction with PIC/S GMP guidelines and annexes describes the manufacture of ATMP active substances and ATMP drug products. However, aspects of these guidelines are also relevant for early stages in the ATMP manufacture (e.g. manufcatur of viral vectors, plasmids) where full GMP is not required under national legislation. As a result, the ATMP manufacturer should make sure that all relevant GMP aspects for the manufacturing of those materials are implemented that ensure process control and consistency, investigation of anomalies and control of change.


            Annex 2A Manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products for human use


            Processing aids Substance used in the manufacture of the active substance and medicinal product, which may be present in the finished product e.g. anti-foaming agents, puffer and media additives (salts, pH indicators), enzymes not considered under raw materials

    heading: MANUFACTURE OF BIOLOGICAL MEDICINAL
    text: "SUBSTANCES AND PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE\n\nSCOPE The methods employed in the manufacture of biological active substances and biological medicinal products for human use (‘biological active substances and medicinal products’) are a critical factor in shaping the appropriate regulatory control. Biological active substances and medicinal products can be defined therefore largely by reference to their method of manufacture. This annex provides guidance on the full range of active substances and medicinal products defined as biological with the exception of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (“ATMPs”). The ATMPs are not covered by the present guideline. Manufacturers of ATMPs should refer to PIC/S Annnex 2A Manufacture of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products for Human Use.\n\nThis annex is divided into two main parts:\n      a)    Part A contains supplementary guidance on the manufacture of biological\n            active substances and medicinal products, from control over seed lots and\n            cell banks through to finishing activities and testing.\n      b)    Part B contains further guidance on selected types of biological active\n            substances and medicinal products.\nThis annex, along with several other annexes of the PIC/S Guide to GMP, provides guidance which supplements that in Part I and in Part II of the Guide. There are two aspects to the scope of this annex:\n      a)    Stage of manufacture - for biological active substances to the point\n            immediately prior to their being rendered sterile, the primary guidance\n            source is Part II. Guidance for the subsequent manufacturing steps of\n            biological products are covered in Part I.\n      b)    Type of product - this annex provides guidance on the full range of\n            medicinal products defined as biological with the exception of ATMPs.\nThese two aspects are shown in Table 1; it should be noted that this table is illustrative only and is not meant to describe the precise scope. It should also be understood that in line with the corresponding table in Part II of the Guide, the level of GMP increases in detail from early to later steps in the manufacture of biological active substances but GMP principles should always be adhered to. The inclusion of some early steps of manufacture within the scope of this Annex does not imply that those steps will be routinely subject to inspection by the authorities.\n\nAnnex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use\n\nAntibiotics are not defined as biological medicinal products, however where biological stages of manufacture occur, guidance in this Annex may be used.\n\nGuidance for medicinal products derived from fractionated human blood or plasma is covered in Annex 14 and for non-transgenic plant products in Annex 7.\n\nIn certain cases, other legislation may be applicable to the starting materials for biologicals.

The ways in which biological medicinal products are manufactured, controlled and administered make some particular precautions necessary.\n\nUnlike conventional medicinal products, which are manufactured using chemical and physical techniques capable of a high degree of consistency, the manufacture of biological active substances and medicinal products involves biological processes and materials, such as cultivation of cells or extraction from living organisms. These biological processes may display inherent variability, so that the range and nature of by-products may be variable. As a result, quality risk management (QRM) principles are particularly important for this class of materials and should be used to develop the control strategy across all stages of manufacture so as to minimise variability and to reduce the opportunity for contamination and cross-contamination.\n\nSince materials and processing conditions used in cultivation processes are designed to provide conditions for the growth of specific cells and microorganisms, this provides extraneous microbial contaminants the opportunity\n\n5    In the EEA: HMPC guideline on Good Agricultural and Collection Practice - EMEA/HMPC/246816/2005 may be applied to growing, harvesting and initial processing in open fields. 6    For principles of GMP apply, see explanatory text in ‘Scope’. 7    In the EEA, human tissues and cells must comply with Directive 2004/23/EC and implementing Directives at these stages.\n\nAnnex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use\n\nto grow. In addition, some products may be limited in their ability to withstand a wide range of purification techniques particularly those designed to inactivate or remove adventitious viral contaminants. The design of the processes, equipment, facilities, utilities, the conditions of preparation and addition of buffers and reagents, sampling and training of the operators are key considerations to minimise such contamination events.\n\nSpecifications related to products (such as those in Pharmacopoeial monographs, Clinical Trial Authorisation (CTA), and Marketing Authorisation (MA)) will dictate whether and to what stage substances and materials can have a defined level of bioburden or need to be sterile. Similarly, manufacturing must be consistent with other specifications set out in the CTA or MA (e.g. number of generations (doublings, passages) between the seed lot or cell bank).\n\nFor biological materials that cannot be sterilized (e.g. by filtration), processing must be conducted aseptically to minimise the introduction of contaminants. Where they exist, other guidance documents should be consulted on the validation of specific manufacturing methods, e.g. virus removal or inactivation. The application of appropriate environmental controls and monitoring and, wherever feasible, in-situ cleaning and sterilisation systems together with the use of closed systems can significantly reduce the risk of accidental contamination and cross-contamination.\n\nControl usually involves biological analytical techniques, which typically have a greater variability than physico-chemical determinations. A robust manufacturing process is therefore crucial and in-process controls take on a particular importance in the manufacture of biological active substances and medicinal products.\n\nBiological medicinal products which incorporate human tissues or cells must comply with national requirements for the coding, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells.8 Collection and testing of this material must be done in accordance with an appropriate quality system and in accordance with applicable national requirements9. Furthermore, national requirements10 on traceability apply from the donor (while maintaining donor confidentiality) through stages applicable at the Tissue Establishment and then continued under medicines legislation through to the institution where the product is used.\n\nBiological active substances and medicinal products must comply with the applicable national guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products.\n\n8    In the EEA, these are Directive 2004/23/EC and Directive 2006/17/EC. 9    In the EEA, this is the Commission Directive 2006/86/EC. 10   In the EEA, this is Directive 2006/86/EC.\n\nAnnex 2B Manufacture of biological medicinal substances and products for human use\n\nPART A:       GENERAL GUIDANCE\n\nPERSONNEL"

      text: For finishing (secondary) operations12, the need for dedicated facilities will depend on consideration of the above together with additional considerations such as the specific needs of the biological medicinal product and on the characteristics of other products, including any non-biological products, in the same facility. Other control measures for finishing operations may include the need for specific addition sequences, mixing speeds, time and temperature controls, limits on exposure to light and containment and cleaning procedures in the event of spillages.

Where negative pressure areas or safety cabinets are used for aseptic processing of materials with particular risks (e.g. pathogens), they should be surrounded by a positive pressure clean zone of appropriate grade. These pressure cascades should be clearly defined and continuously monitored with appropriate alarm settings.

Instances of ill-health occurring in the source/donor animals should be investigated with respect to their suitability and the suitability of in-contact animals for continued use (in manufacture, as sources of starting and raw materials, in quality control and safety testing), the decisions must be documented. A look-back procedure should be in place which informs the decision making process on the continued suitability of the biological active substanceor medicinal productin which the animal sourced starting or raw materials have been used or incorporated. This decision-making process may include the re-testing of retained samples from previous collections from the same donor animal (where applicable) to establish the last negative donation. The withdrawal period of therapeutic agents used to treat source/donor animals must be documented and used to determine the removal of those animals from the programme for defined periods.

Traceability records must be retained for 30 years after the expiry date of the medicinal product. Particular care should be taken to maintain the traceability of products for special use cases, such as donor-matched cells. National requirements16 in regards to traceability requirements and notification of serious adverse reactions and events apply to blood components when they are used as starting or raw materials in the manufacturing process of medicinal products.

      text: The source, origin and suitability of biological starting and raw materials (e.g. cryoprotectants, feeder cells, reagents, culture media, buffers, serum, enzymes, cytokines, growth factors) should be clearly defined. Where the necessary tests take a long time, it may be permissible to process starting materials before the results of the tests are available, the risk of using a potentially failed material and its potential impact on other batches should be clearly understood and assessed under the principles of QRM. In such cases, release of a finished product is conditional on satisfactory results of these tests. The identification of all starting materials should be in compliance with the requirements appropriate to its stage of manufacture. For biological medicinal products further guidance can be found in Part I and Annex 8 and for biological active substances in Part II.

The controls required for the quality of starting and raw materials and on the aseptic manufacturing process, assume greater importance particularly for products, in respect of which final sterilisation is not possible. Where a CTA or MA provides for an allowable type and level of bioburden, for example at active substance stage, the control strategy should address the means by which this is maintained within the specified limits.

This should include an appropriately controlled environment to protect the seed lot and the cell bank and the personnel handling it. During the establishment of the seed lot and cell bank, no other living or infectious material (e.g. virus, cell lines or cell strains) should be handled simultaneously in the same area or by the same persons. For all stages prior to the establishment of the master seed or cell bank generation, principles of GMP may be applied. For all pre-master bank stages, documentation should be available to support traceability. All issues related to components used during the development with potential impact on product safety (e.g. reagents of biological origin) from initial sourcing and genetic development should be documented. For vaccines the requirements of pharmacopoeial monographs will apply24.

    text: 'PRINCIPLE The manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals should be undertaken in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products Part I and II. This annex specifically addresses some of the practices, which may be specific for radiopharmaceuticals.


      Note i. Preparation of radiopharmaceuticals in radiopharmacies (hospitals or certain pharmacies), using Generators and Kits with a marketing authorisation or a national licence, is not covered by this guideline, unless covered by national requirement.


      Note ii. According to radiation protection regulations it should be ensured that any medical exposure is under the clinical responsibility of a practitioner. In diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine practices a medical physics expert should be available.


      Note iii. This annex is also applicable to radiopharmaceuticals used in clinical trials.


      Note iv. Transport of radiopharmaceuticals is regulated by the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) and radiation protection requirements.


      Note v. It is recognised that there are acceptable methods, other than those described in this annex, which are capable of achieving the principles of Quality Assurance. Other methods should be validated and provide a level of Quality Assurance at least equivalent to those set out in this annex.

      text: The manufacturing and handling of radiopharmaceuticals is potentially hazardous. The level of risk depends in particular upon the types of radiation, the energy of radiation and the half-lives of radioactive isotopes. Particular attention must be paid to the prevention of cross-contamination, to the retention of radionuclide contaminants, and to waste disposal.

    text: 'PRINCIPLE The manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products has special characteristics which should be taken into consideration when implementing and assessing the quality assurance system.


      Due to the large number of animal species and related pathogenic agents, the variety of products manufactured is very wide and the volume of manufacture is often low; hence, work on a campaign basis is common. Moreover, because of the very nature of this manufacture (cultivation steps, lack of terminal sterilization, etc.), the products must be particularly well protected against contamination and cross-contamination. The environment also must be protected especially when the manufacture involves the use of pathogenic or exotic biological agents and the worker must be particularly well protected when the manufacture involves the use of biological agents pathogenic to man.


      These factors, together with the inherent variability of immunological veterinary medicinal products and the relative inefficiency in particular of final product quality control tests in providing adequate information about products, means that the role of the quality assurance system is of the utmost importance. The need to maintain control over all of the following aspects of GMP, as well as those outlined in this Guide, cannot be overemphasized. In particular, it is important that the data generated by the monitoring of the various aspects of GMP (equipment, premises, product etc.) are rigorously assessed and informed decisions, leading to appropriate action, are made and recorded.

        Prevention of contamination by personnel should be achieved by a set of measures and procedures to ensure that appropriate protective clothing is used during the different stages of the production process.


        Prevention of cross-contamination by personnel involved in production should be achieved by a set of measures and procedures to ensure that they do not pass from one area to another unless they have taken appropriate measures to eliminate the risk of contamination. In the course of a working day, personnel should not pass from areas where contamination with live microorganisms is likely or where animals are housed to premises where other products or organisms are handled. If such a passage is unavoidable, clearly defined decontamination procedures, including change of clothing and shoes, and, where necessary, showering, should be followed by staff involved in any such production.


        Personnel entering a contained area where organisms had not been handled in open circuit operations in the previous twelve hours to check on cultures in sealed, surface decontaminated flasks would not be regarded as being at risk of contamination, unless the organism involved was an exotic.

    text: 'PRINCIPLE This Annex deals with the manufacture of active substance gases and the manufacture of medicinal gases.


      The delineation between the manufacture of the active substance and the manufacture of the medicinal product should be clearly defined in each Marketing Authorisation dossier. Normally, the production and purification steps of the gas belong to the field of manufacture of active substances. Gases enter the pharmaceutical field from the first storage of gas intended for such use.


      Manufacture of active substance gases should comply with the Basic Requirements of this Guide (Part II), with the relevant part of this Annex, and with the other Annexes of the Guide if relevant.


      Manufacture of medicinal gases should comply with the basic requirements of this Guide (Part I), with the relevant part of this Annex and with the other Annexes of the Guide if relevant.


      In the exceptional cases of continuous processes where no intermediate storage of gas between the manufacture of the active substance and the manufacture of the medicinal product is possible, the whole process (from starting materials of active substance to medicinal finished product) should be considered as belonging to the pharmaceutical field. This should be clearly stated in the Marketing Authorisation dossier.


      The Annex does not cover the manufacture and handling of medicinal gases in hospitals unless this is considered industrial preparation or manufacturing. However, relevant parts of this Annex may be used as a basis for such activities.


      Manufacture of active substance gases


      Active substance gases can be prepared by chemical synthesis or be obtained from natural sources followed by purification steps, if necessary (as for example in an air separation plant).'

        b) clear identification and segregation of cylinders/mobile cryogenic vessels at various stages of processing (e.g. “waiting checking”, "awaiting filling", "quarantine", "certified", “rejected “,“prepared deliveries”).


        The method used to achieve these various levels of segregation will depend on the nature, extent and complexity of the overall operation. Marked-out floor areas, partitions, barriers, signs, labels or other appropriate means could be used.'

      text: Equipment should be designed to ensure the correct gas is filled into the correct container. There should normally be no cross connections between pipelines carrying different gases. If cross connections are needed (e.g. filling equipment of mixtures), qualification should ensure that there is no risk of cross contamination between the different gases. In addition, the manifolds should be equipped with specific connections. These connections may be subject to international or national standards. The use of connections meeting different standards at the same filling site should be carefully controlled, as well as the use of adaptors needed in some situations to bypass the specific fill connection systems.

      text: Cylinders, mobile cryogenic vessels and valves should conform to appropriate technical specifications and any relevant requirements of the Marketing Authorisation. They should be dedicated to a single medicinal gas or to a given mixture of medicinal gases. Cylinders should be colour-coded according to relevant standards. They should preferably be fitted with minimum pressure retention valves with non-return mechanism in order to get adequate protection against contamination.

      text: 'Unless different provisions are required in the Marketing Authorisation, the sampling plan and the analysis to be performed should comply, in the case of cylinders with the following requirements.


        a) In the case of a single medicinal gas filled via a multi-cylinder manifold, the gas from at least one cylinder from each manifold filling cycle should be tested for identity and assay each time the cylinders are changed on the manifold.


        b) In the case of a single medicinal gas filled put into cylinders one at a time, the gas from at least one cylinder of each uninterrupted filling cycle should be tested for identity and assay. An example of an uninterrupted filling cycle is one shift''s production using the same personnel, equipment, and batch of gas to be filled.


        c) In the case of a medicinal gas produced by mixing two or more gases in a cylinder from the same manifold, the gas from every cylinder should be tested


        for assay and identity of each component gas. For excipients, if any, testing on identity could be performed on one cylinder per manifold filling cycle (or per uninterrupted filling cycle in case of cylinders filled one at a time). Fewer cylinders may be tested in case of validated automated filling system.


        d) Premixed gases should follow the same principles as single gases when continuous in-line testing of the mixture to be filled is performed.


        Premixed gases should follow the same principle as medicinal gases produced by mixing gases in the cylinders when there is no continuous in-line testing of the mixture to be filled.


        Testing for water content should be performed unless otherwise justified.


        Other sampling and testing procedures that provide at least equivalent level of quality assurance may be justified'

    heading: MANUFACTURE OF HERBAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS
    text: "PRINCIPLE Because of their often complex and variable nature, control of starting materials, storage and processing assume particular importance in the manufacture of herbal medicinal products.\n\nThe “starting material” in the manufacture of an herbal medicinal product1 can be a medicinal plant, an herbal substance2 or an herbal preparation1. The herbal substance should be of suitable quality and supporting data should be provided to the manufacturer of the herbal preparation/herbal medicinal product. Ensuring consistent quality of the herbal substance may require more detailed information on its agricultural production. The selection of seeds, cultivation and harvesting conditions represent important aspects of the quality of the herbal substance and can influence the consistency of the finished product. Recommendations on an appropriate quality assurance system for good agricultural and collection practice are provided in national or international guidance documents on Good Agricultural and Collection Practice for starting materials of herbal origin3.\n\nThis Annex applies to all herbal starting materials: medicinal plants, herbal substances or herbal preparations.\n\n1 Throughout the annex and unless otherwise specified, the term “herbal medicinal product / preparation” includes “traditional herbal medicinal product / preparation”. 2    The terms herbal substance and herbal preparation are considered to be equivalent to the terms herbal drug and herbal drug preparation respectively. 3    European Medicines Agency (EMA), World Health Organization (WHO) or equivalent.\n\nTable illustrating the application of Good Practices to the manufacture of herbal medicinal products 4\n    Activity                                            Good Agricultural           Part II of   Part I of\n                                                        and Collection              the GMP      the GMP\n                                                        Practice (GACP) #           Guide †      Guide †\nCultivation, collection and harvesting of plants, algae, fungi and lichens, and collection of exudates Cutting, and drying of plants, algae, fungi, lichens and exudates * Expression from plants and distillation** Comminution, processing of exudates, extraction from plants, fractionation, purification, concentration or fermentation of herbal substances Further processing into a dosage form including packaging as a medicinal product\n\nExplanatory Notes † ..The GMP classification of the herbal material is dependent upon the use made of it by the manufacturing authorisation holder. The material may be classified as an active substance, an intermediate or a finished product. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer of the medicinal product to ensure that the appropriate GMP classification is applied.\n\n* Manufacturers should ensure that these steps are carried out in accordance with the marketing authorisation / registration. For those initial steps that take place in the field, as justified in the marketing authorisation / registration, the national or international standards of Good Agricultural and Collection Practice for starting materials of herbal origin (GACP)# are applicable. GMP is applicable to further cutting and drying steps.\n\n** Regarding the expression from plants and distillation, if it is necessary for these activities to be an integral part of harvesting to maintain the quality of the product within the approved specifications, it is acceptable that they are performed in the field, provided that the cultivation is in compliance with national or international standards of GACP#. These circumstances should be regarded as exceptional and justified in the relevant marketing authorisation / registration documentation. For activities carried out in the field, appropriate documentation, control, and validation according to the GMP principles should be assured. Regulatory authorities may carry out GMP inspections of these activities in order to assess compliance.\n\n4    This table expands in detail the herbal section of Table 1 in Part II of the GMP Guide. #    EMA, WHO or equivalent\n\nPREMISES Storage areas"

Valid conclusions on the whole cannot be based on tests which have been carried out on non-representative samples. Correct sampling is thus an essential part of a system of Quality Assurance.\n\nNote: Sampling is dealt with in Chapter 6 of the Guide to GMP, items 6.11 to\n             6.14. These supplementary guidelines give additional guidance on the\n             sampling of starting and packaging materials.\nPERSONNEL"

    heading: MANUFACTURE OF INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS
    text: 'INTRODUCTION These guidelines lay down appropriate tools to address specific issues concerning investigational medicinal products with regard to good manufacturing practice. The tools are flexible to provide for changes as knowledge of the process increases and appropriate to the stage of development of the product.


      An investigational medicinal product is a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorisation when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorised form, or when used for an unauthorised indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorised form.


      Unless otherwise defined in national law, manufacturing is defined as total and partial manufacture, as well as the various processes of dividing up, packaging and labelling (including blinding).


      Investigational medicinal products shall be manufactured by applying manufacturing practices which ensure the quality of such medicinal products in order to safeguard the safety of the subject and the reliability and robustness of clinical data generated in the clinical trial ("good manufacturing practice").


      The good manufacturing practice requirements for investigational medicinal products are set out in these guidelines. Various other parts of the PIC/S GMP Guide provide useful guidance also and they should be considered.


      Procedures need to be flexible to provide for changes as knowledge of the process increases and appropriate to the stage of development of the products.


      In clinical trials there may be added risk to the subjects compared to patients treated with authorised medicinal products. The application of good manufacturing practice for the manufacture and import of investigational medicinal products is intended to ensure that subjects are not placed at undue risk, and that the results of clinical trials are unaffected by inadequate quality, safety or efficacy arising from unsatisfactory manufacture or import. (Note: the reference to ‘Import’ here and in other parts of this annex refers to importation activities into the relevant country, which should be performed in accordance with applicable national laws/requirements.) Equally, it is intended to ensure that there is consistency between batches of the same investigational medicinal product used in the same or different clinical trials and that changes during the development of an investigational medicinal product are adequately documented and justified.


      The production of investigational medicinal products involves added complexity in comparison with authorised medicinal products by virtue of lack of fixed routines, variety of clinical trial designs and consequent packaging designs. Randomisation and blinding add to that complexity an increased risk of product cross-contamination and mix-up. Furthermore, there may be incomplete knowledge of the potency and toxicity of the product and a lack of full process validation. Moreover, authorised products may be used which have been repackaged or modified in some way. These challenges require personnel with a thorough understanding of and training in the application of good manufacturing practice to investigational medicinal products. The increased complexity in manufacturing operations requires a highly effective quality system.


      For manufacturers to be able to apply and comply with good manufacturing practice for investigational medicinal products, co-operation between manufacturers and sponsors of clinical trials is required. This co-operation should be described in a technical agreement between the sponsor and manufacturer.'

      text: 'SCOPE These guidelines apply to manufacture or import of investigational medicinal products for human use.


        Reconstitution of investigational medicinal products is not considered manufacturing, unless otherwise subject to national law, and therefore is not covered by this guideline.


        The reconstitution is understood as the simple process of dissolving or dispersing the investigational medicinal product for administration of the product to a trial subject, or diluting or mixing the investigation medicinal product with some other substance(s) used as a vehicle for the purpose of administering it to a trial subject.


        Reconstitution is not mixing several ingredients, including the active substance, together to produce the investigational medicinal product. An investigational medicinal product must exist before a process can be defined as reconstitution.


        The process of reconstitution has to be undertaken as close in time as possible to administration and has to be defined in the clinical trial application dossier and document available at the clinical trial site.


        While these guidelines do not apply to the activities listed below, PIC/S Participating Authorities should, in accordance with national law, make those processes subject to appropriate and proportionate requirements to ensure subject safety and reliability and robustness of the data generated in the clinical trial:'

        The product specifications and manufacturing instructions may be changed during development, but full control and traceability of the changes should be documented and maintained. Deviations from any predefined specifications and instructions should be registered, investigated and corrective and preventive action measures initiated as appropriate.


        The selection, qualification, approval and maintenance of suppliers of starting materials, together with their purchase and acceptance, should be documented as part of the pharmaceutical quality system to ensure the integrity of the supply chain and protect against falsified products. The level of supervision should be proportionate to the risks posed by the individual materials, taking into account their source, manufacturing process, supply chain complexity and the final use to which the material is put in the investigational medicinal product. The supporting evidence for each supplier approval and material approval should be documented and maintained.

      text: The toxicity, potency or sensitising potential may not be fully understood for investigational medicinal products and this reinforces the need to minimise all risks of cross-contamination. The design of equipment and premises, inspection/test methods and acceptance limits to be used after cleaning should reflect the nature of these risks and take account of the quality risk management principles detailed in Chapters 3 and 5 of Part 1 of the PIC/S GMP Guide.

If practicable, and otherwise consistent with simulating the process, a larger number of units should be filled with media to provide greater confidence in the results obtained. Filling and sealing is often a manual or semi-automated operation presenting great challenges to sterility, so enhanced attention should be given to operator training and validating the aseptic technique of individual operators.

      text: "Records of destruction operations should be retained, including a dated certificate of destruction or a receipt for destruction to the sponsor. These documents should clearly identify or allow traceability to the batches and/or patient numbers involved and the actual quantities destroyed.\n\nGLOSSARY TO ANNEX 13 Blinding A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are kept unaware of the treatment assignment(s). Single-blinding usually refers to the subject(s) being unaware, and double-blinding usually refers to the subject(s), investigator(s), monitor, and, in some cases, data analyst(s) being unaware of the treatment assignment(s). In relation to an investigational medicinal product, blinding shall mean the deliberate disguising of the identity of the product in accordance with the instructions of the sponsor. Unblinding shall mean the disclosure of the identity of blinded products.\n\nCampaign manufacturing Manufacturing a series of batches of the same product in sequence in a given period of time followed by an appropriate (validated) cleaning procedure.\n\nClinical trial Any investigation in human subjects intended to discover or verify the clinical, pharmacological and/or other pharmacodynamic effects of an investigational product(s) and/or to identify any adverse reactions to an investigational product(s), and/or to study absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of one or more investigational medicinal product(s) with the object of ascertaining its/their safety and/or efficacy.\n\nComparator product An investigational medicinal product used as a reference, including as a placebo, in a clinical trial.\n\nExpiry date The date placed on the container/labels of an investigational medicinal products designating the time during which the investigational medicinal products is expected to remain within established shelf life specifications if stored under defined conditions, and after which it should not be used.\n\nInvestigational medicinal product A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorisation when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorised form, or when used for an unauthorised indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorised form.\n\nInvestigator A person responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. If a trial is conducted by a team of individuals at a trial site, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team and may be called the principal investigator.\n\nManufacturer/importer of Investigational Medicinal Products Any holder of the authorisation to manufacture/import.\n\nManufacture All operations of purchase of materials and products, production, quality control, release, storage, distribution of investigational medicinal products and the related controls. Note that the word 'preparation' as used in this Annex should be taken as synonymous with the word ‘manufacture’.\n\nOrder The order should request the processing and/or packaging of a certain number of units and/or their shipment and be given by or on behalf of the sponsor to the manufacturer.\n\nPreparation See ‘Manufacture’ above.\n\nProduct Specification File A reference file containing, or referring to files containing, all the information necessary to draft the detailed written instructions on processing, packaging, quality control testing, batch release and shipping of an investigational medicinal product.\n\nRandomisation The process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce bias.\n\nRandomisation Code A listing in which the treatment assigned to each subject from the randomisation process is identified.\n\nRetest date The date when a material should be re-examined to ensure that it is still suitable for use.\n\nRegulatory Release The verification of batch certification and that the clinical trial site is trained, qualified and has the necessary approvals, thus is ready to receive investigational medicinal product.\n\nShipping The operation of packaging for shipment and sending of ordered medicinal products for clinical trials.\n\nSponsor An individual, company, institution or organisation which takes responsibility for the initiation, management and/or financing of a clinical trial.\n      Annex 14      Manufacture of medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma"

        GLOSSARY Blood Blood1 means whole blood collected from a single (human) donor and processed either for transfusion or for further manufacturing.


        Blood component A blood component2 means a therapeutic constituent of blood (red cells, white cells, platelets and plasma) that can be prepared by various methods, using conventional blood bank methodology (e.g. centrifugation, filtration, freezing). This does not include haematopoietic progenitor cells.


        Blood establishment A blood establishment3 is any structure or body that is responsible for any aspect of the collection and testing of human blood and blood components, whatever their intended purpose, and their processing, storage and distribution when intended for transfusion.


        Blood products A blood product4 means any therapeutic product derived from human blood or plasma.


        Fractionation, fractionation plant Fractionation is the manufacturing process in a plant (fractionation plant) during which plasma components are separated/purified by various physical and chemical methods such as e.g. precipitation, chromatography.


        1    For EU/EEA as referred to in Directive 2002/98/EC (Art. 3a) 2    For EU/EEA as referred to in Directive 2002/98/EC (Art. 3b) 3    For EU/EEA as referred to in Directive 2002/98/EC (Art. 3e) 4    For EU/EEA as referred to in Directive 2002/98/EC (Art. 3c)


        Good Practice guidelines Good practice guidelines give interpretation on the national standards and specifications defined for quality systems in blood establishments5.


        Medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma Medicinal products derived from human blood or human plasma6 are medicinal products based on blood constituents which are prepared industrially by public or private establishments.


        Plasma for fractionation Plasma for fractionation is the liquid part of human blood remaining after separation of the cellular elements from blood collected in a container containing an anticoagulant, or separated by continuous filtration or centrifugation of anti-coagulated blood in an apheresis procedure; it is intended for the manufacture of plasma derived medicinal products, in particular albumin, coagulation factors and immunoglobulins of human origin and specified in the European (or other relevant) Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) monograph “Human Plasma for fractionation” (0853).


        Plasma Master File (PMF) A Plasma Master File7 is a stand-alone document, which is separate from the dossier for marketing authorisation. It provides all relevant detailed information on the characteristics of the entire human plasma used as a starting material and/or a raw material for the manufacture of sub/intermediate fractions, constituents of the excipients and active substances, which are part of plasma, derived medicinal products or medical devices.


        Processing Processing8 means any step in the preparation of blood component that is carried out between the collection of blood and the issuing of a blood component, e.g. separation and freezing of blood components. In this Annex, processing in addition refers to those operations performed at the blood establishment that are specific to plasma to be used for fractionation.


        Responsible Person (RP) A person responsible for securing that each batch of (biological) active substance or medicinal product has been manufactured and checked in compliance with the laws in force and in accordance with the specifications and/or requirements of the marketing authorisation. The RP is equivalent to the EU term “Qualified Person” 9.


        Responsible Person (RP) for blood establishment A person responsible for ensuring that every unit of blood or blood components has been collected and tested, processed, stored and distributed in compliance with the laws in force. This term is equivalent to the EU term “Responsible Person”10.


        5    For EU/EEA as established in the Annex of Directive 2005/62/EC 6    For EU/EEA as referred to as referred to in Directive 2001/83/EC (Art. 1 No. 10) 7    For EU/EEA as referred to in Directive 2001/83/EC (Annex I, Part III, No. 1.1.a) 8    For EU/EEA as according to the terminology of directive 2005/62/EC 9    For EU/EEA, see Article 48 of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 52 of Directive 2001/82/EC. 10   For EU/EEA, see Article 9 of Directive 2002/98/EC.


        Contract fractionation program This is a contract fractionation in a national plant of a fractionator/manufacturer, using starting material from other countries and manufacturing products not intended for the national market.'

        text: Medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma (and their active substances which are used as starting materials) must comply with the principles and guidelines of Good Manufacturing Practice12 as well as the relevant marketing authorisation. They are considered to be biological medicinal products and the starting materials include biological substances, such as cells or fluids (including blood or plasma) of human origin. Certain special features arise from the biological nature of the source material. For example, diseasetransmitting agents, especially viruses, may contaminate the source material. The quality and safety of these products relies therefore on the control of source materials and their origin as well as on the subsequent manufacturing procedures, including infectious marker testing, virus removal and virus inactivation.

Detailed investigation of failures in virus inactivation procedures should be performed. Adherence to the validated production process is especially important in the virus reduction procedures as any deviation could result in a safety risk for the final product. Procedures which take this risk into consideration should be in place.

    heading: QUALIFICATION AND VALIDATION
    text: 'PRINCIPLE


      This Annex describes the principles of qualification and validation which are applicable to the facilities, equipment, utilities and processes used for the manufacture of medicinal products and may also be used as supplementary optional guidance for active substances without introduction of additional requirements to Part II. It is a GMP requirement that manufacturers control the critical aspects of their particular operations through qualification and validation over the life cycle of the product and process. Any planned changes to the facilities, equipment, utilities and processes, which may affect the quality of the product, should be formally documented and the impact on the validated status or control strategy assessed. Computerised systems used for the manufacture of medicinal products should also be validated according to the requirements of Annex 11. The relevant concepts and guidance presented in ICH Q8, Q9, Q10 and Q11 should also be taken into account.


      GENERAL A quality risk management approach should be applied throughout the lifecycle of a medicinal product. As part of a quality risk management system, decisions on the scope and extent of qualification and validation should be based on a justified and documented risk assessment of the facilities, equipment, utilities and processes. Retrospective validation is no longer considered an acceptable approach.


      Data supporting qualification and/or validation studies which were obtained from sources outside of the manufacturers own programmes may be used provided that this approach has been justified and that there is adequate assurance that controls were in place throughout the acquisition of such data.'

      text: "Definitions of terms relating to qualification and validation which are not given in other sections of the current PIC/S Guide to GMP are given below.\n\nBracketing approach: A science and risk based validation approach such that only batches on the extremes of certain predetermined and justified design factors, e.g. strength, batch size, and/or pack size, are tested during process validation. The design assumes that validation of any intermediate levels is represented by validation of the extremes. Where a range of strengths is to be validated, bracketing could be applicable if the strengths are identical or very closely related in composition, e.g. for a tablet range made with different compression weights of a similar basic granulation, or a capsule range made by filling different plug fill weights of the same basic composition into different size capsule shells. Bracketing can be applied to different container sizes or different fills in the same container closure system. Change Control A formal system by which qualified representatives of appropriate disciplines review proposed or actual changes that might affect the validated status of facilities, systems, equipment or processes. The intent is to determine the need for action to ensure and document that the system is maintained in a validated state. Cleaning Validation Cleaning validation is documented evidence that an approved cleaning procedure will reproducibly remove the previous product or cleaning agents used in the equipment below the scientifically set maximum allowable carryover level. Cleaning verification The gathering of evidence through chemical analysis after each batch/campaign to show that the residues of the previous product or cleaning agents have been reduced below the scientifically set maximum allowable carryover level.\n\nConcurrent Validation Validation carried out in exceptional circumstances, justified on the basis of significant patient benefit, where the validation protocol is executed concurrently with commercialisation of the validation batches. Continuous process verification An alternative approach to process validation in which manufacturing process performance is continuously monitored and evaluated. (ICH Q8)\n\nControl Strategy: A planned set of controls, derived from current product and process understanding that ensures process performance and product quality. The controls can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control. (ICH Q10) Critical process parameter (CPP) A process parameter whose variability has an impact on a critical quality attribute and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces the desired quality. (ICH Q8) Critical quality attribute (CQA) A physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an approved limit, range or distribution to ensure the desired product quality. (ICH Q8) Design qualification (DQ) The documented verification that the proposed design of the facilities, systems and equipment is suitable for the intended purpose. Design Space The multidimensional combination and interaction of input variables, e.g. material attributes, and process parameters that have been demonstrated to provide assurance of quality. Working within the design space is not considered as a change. Movement out of the design space is considered to be a change and would normally initiate a regulatory post approval change process. Design space is proposed by the applicant and is subject to regulatory assessment and approval. (ICH Q8) Installation Qualification (IQ) The documented verification that the facilities, systems and equipment, as installed or modified, comply with the approved design and the manufacturer’s recommendations. Knowledge management A systematic approach to acquire, analyse, store and disseminate information. (ICH Q10) Lifecycle All phases in the life of a product, equipment or facility from initial development or use through to discontinuation of use. Ongoing Process Verification (also known as continued process verification) Documented evidence that the process remains in a state of control during commercial manufacture. Operational Qualification (OQ) The documented verification that the facilities, systems and equipment, as installed or modified, perform as intended throughout the anticipated operating ranges.\n\nPerformance Qualification (PQ) The documented verification that systems and equipment can perform effectively and reproducibly based on the approved process method and product specification. Process Validation The documented evidence that the process, operated within established parameters, can perform effectively and reproducibly to produce a medicinal product meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes. Product realisation Achievement of a product with the quality attributes to meet the needs of patients, health care professionals and regulatory authorities and internal customer requirements. (ICH Q10) Prospective Validation Validation carried out before routine production of products intended for sale. Quality by design A systematic approach that begins with predefined objectives and emphasises product and process understanding and process control, based on sound science and quality risk management. Quality risk management A systematic process for the assessment, control, communication and review of risks to quality across the lifecycle. (ICH Q9) Simulated agents A material that closely approximates the physical and, where practical, the chemical characteristics, e.g. viscosity, particle size, pH etc., of the product under validation. State of control A condition in which the set of controls consistently provides assurance of acceptable process performance and product quality. Traditional approach A product development approach where set points and operating ranges for process parameters are defined to ensure reproducibility. User requirements Specification (URS) The set of owner, user, and engineering requirements necessary and sufficient to create a feasible design meeting the intended purpose of the system. Worst Case A condition or set of conditions encompassing upper and lower processing limits and circumstances, within standard operating procedures, which pose the greatest chance of product or process failure when compared to ideal conditions. Such conditions do not necessarily induce product or process failure.\n                                     Annex 16    Authorised person and batch release"

    text: '               BATCH RELEASE

      SCOPE This Annex provides guidance on the certification by an Authorised Person and on batch release of medicinal products for human or veterinary use within a Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) Participating Authority or made for export. The principles of this guidance also apply to investigational medicinal products (IMP) for human use, subject to any difference in the legal provisions and more specific guidance published by PIC/S Participating Authorities under national law.


      Guidance in this Annex on the certification of batches by a manufacturer of a medicinal product is within the scope of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme. However, each PIC/S Participating Authority may decide whether guidance expressed in this annex should become a legally-binding standard in relation to imported medicinal products.


      This Annex does not address any controls on release of medicinal products by a National Competent Authority under national law (e.g. certain blood and immunological products); however, this Annex does apply to the Authorised Person certification and subsequent release of such batches.


      The basic arrangements for batch release for a medicinal product are defined by its marketing authorisation (MA). Nothing in this Annex should be taken as overriding those arrangements.


      GENERAL PRINCIPLES The ultimate responsibility for the performance of a medicinal product over its lifetime, its safety, quality and efficacy, lies with the marketing authorisation holder (MAH).


      However, the Authorised Person is responsible for ensuring that each individual batch has been manufactured and checked in compliance with national requirements in accordance with the requirements of the marketing authorisation (MA) and with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).


      The process of batch release comprises of:'

      text: 'THE PROCESS OF CERTIFICATION 1.1.      Each batch of finished product must be certified2 by an Authorised Person before being released for sale, supply or export. Certification can only be performed by an Authorised Person of the manufacturer and/or importer which are described in the MA.


        1.2.      Any Authorised Person involved in the certification or confirmation of a batch must have detailed knowledge of the steps for which they are taking responsibility. The Authorised Persons should be able to prove their continuous training regarding the product type, production processes, technical advances and changes to GMP.


        1.3.      There may be several sites involved in the various stages of manufacture, importation, testing and storage of a batch before it undergoes certification. Regardless of how many sites are involved, the Authorised Person performing certification of the finished product must ensure that all necessary steps have been completed under accepted pharmaceutical quality systems to assure compliance of the batch with GMP, the MA and any other national requirements where certification is taking place.


        1         Information required for the confirmation, where Authorised Person responsibilities for the batch are being transferred between sites, is recommended in Appendix I to this Annex. 2         The contents of a batch certificate for medicinal products are recommended in Appendix II to this Annex. The content of a batch certificate may differ from Appendix II as required under national law or as required to facilitate arrangements between National Competent Authorities.


        1.4.    Each manufacturing site must have at least one Authorised Person.


        1.4.1   Where the site only undertakes partial manufacturing operations in relation to a batch, then an Authorised Person at that site must at least confirm that the operations undertaken by the site have been performed in accordance with GMP and the terms of the written agreement detailing the operations for which the site is responsible. If the Authorised Person is responsible for providing confirmation of compliance for those operations with the relevant MA, then the Authorised Person should have access to the necessary details of the MA.


        1.4.2   The Authorised Person who performs certification of the finished product batch should assume full responsibility for all stages of manufacture of the batch or this responsibility may be shared with other Authorised Persons who have provided confirmation for specified steps in the manufacture and control of a batch. These could be other Authorised Persons who are operating under the same manufacturing authorisation holder or operating under different manufacturing authorisation holders


        1.4.3   Any sharing of responsibilities amongst Authorised Persons in relation to compliance of a batch must be defined in a written agreement. This document should detail responsibility for assessment of the impact any deviation(s) has/have on compliance of the batch with GMP and the MA.'

        text: 'For medicinal products manufactured outside the jurisdiction of a National Competent Authority, physical importation and certification are the final stages of manufacturing which precede the transfer to saleable stock of the batch, depending on national law.


          1.5.1   The process of certification as described in Section 1 of this Annex, applies to all medicinal products intended to be released within domestic markets, or for export, irrespective of the complexity of the supply chain and the global locations of manufacturing sites involved.


          1.5.2   In accordance with the principles described in Section 1.4 of this Annex and the law in each jurisdiction, the Authorised Person certifying the finished medicinal product batch may take account of the confirmation by, and share defined responsibilities with, other Authorised Persons in relation to any manufacturing or importation operations taking place at other sites in the same jurisdiction and other manufacturing authorisation holders defined in the relevant MA.


          1.5.3   Conditions of storage and transport for the batch and the sample, if sent separately, should be taken into account by the Authorised Person before certification of a batch.


          1.5.4   The Authorised Person certifying the finished product is responsible for ensuring that each finished medicinal product batch has been manufactured in accordance with GMP and the MA. The Authorised Person is also responsible for ensuring that the finished medicinal product batch has undergone testing required upon importation in accordance with national law.


          1.5.5   If sampling of imported product is necessary, it should be fully representative of the batch. Samples may either be taken after arrival in the jurisdiction of the National Competent Authority, or be taken at the manufacturing site located in


          another jurisdiction in accordance with national law and a technically justified approach which is documented within the company’s quality system. Responsibilities in relation to the sampling should be defined in a written agreement between the sites. Any samples taken outside the National Competent Authority jurisdiction should be shipped under equivalent transport conditions as the batch that they represent.


          1.5.6   Where sampling is performed at a manufacturing site located in another jurisdiction, the technical justification should include a formal Quality Risk Management process to identify and manage any risks associated with this approach. This should be fully documented and include at least the following elements:'

          GLOSSARY TO ANNEX 16 Certain words and phrases in this annex are used with the particular meanings defined below. Reference should also be made to the Glossary in the main part of the PIC/S GMP Guide.


          Certification of the finished product batch The certification in a document by an Authorised Person, as defined in this annex, and represents the quality release of the batch before the batch is released for sale or distribution.


          Confirmation (Confirm and confirmed have equivalent meanings) A signed statement by an Authorised Person that a process or test has been conducted in accordance with GMP and the relevant marketing authorisation or clinical trial authorisation, product specification file and/or technical agreement, as applicable, as agreed in writing with the Authorised Person responsible for certifying the finished product batch before release. The Authorised Person providing a confirmation takes responsibility for those activities being confirmed.


          Finished product batch With reference to the control or test of the finished product, a finished medicinal product batch is an entity which comprises all the units of a pharmaceutical form which are made from the same initial quantity of material and have undergone the same series of manufacturing and/or sterilisation operations or, in the case of a continuous production process, all the units manufactured in a given period of time. In the context of this annex the term in particular denotes the batch of product in its final pack for release to the market.


          Importer Any holder of the authorisation to import as required by national law.


          Jurisdiction A jurisdiction is a territory within which a court or government agency is exercising its power. A jurisdiction can be e.g. a State (whether internationally recognised or not) or a region.

In specific circumstances, where authorised, based on product knowledge and process understanding, information collected during the manufacturing process can be used instead of end-product testing for batch release. Any separate activities required for this form of batch release should be integrated into the Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS).

Interaction with all relevant regulatory authorities prior and during the assessment process preceding regulatory approval is required. The level of interaction will depend on the level of complexity of the RTRT control procedure applied on site.

Any change that could potentially impact product manufacturing and testing, or the validated status of facilities, systems, equipment, analytical methods or processes, should be assessed for risk to product quality and impact on reproducibility of the manufacturing process. Any change should be justified by the sound application of quality risk management principles, and fully documented. After change implementation, an evaluation should be undertaken to demonstrate that there are no unintended or deleterious impact on product quality.

        text: An end-product test for sterility is limited in its ability to detect contamination as it utilises only a small number of samples in relation to the overall batch size, and secondly, culture media may only stimulate growth of some, but not all, microorganisms. Therefore, an end-product testing for sterility only provides an opportunity to detect major failures in the sterility assurance system (i.e. a failure that results in contamination of a large number of product units and/or that result in contamination by the specific microorganisms whose growth is supported by the prescribed media). In contrast, data derived from in-process controls (e.g. pre-sterilisation product bioburden or environmental monitoring) and by monitoring relevant sterilisation parameters can provide more accurate and relevant information to support sterility assurance of the product.

If a new product or process is being considered for parametric release, then a risk assessment should be conducted during process development including an evaluation of production data from existing products if applicable. If an existing product or process is being considered, the risk assessment should include an evaluation of any historical data generated.

The controls can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control.\n\nCritical Process Parameters: A process parameter whose variability has an impact on a critical quality attribute and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces the desired quality [ICH Q8 (R2)].\n\nCritical Quality Attributes A physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality. [ICH Q8 (R2)]\n\nParametric release One form of RTRT. Parametric release for terminally sterilised product is based on the review of documentation on process monitoring (e.g. temperature, pressure, time for terminal sterilisation) rather than the testing of a sample for a specific attribute (ICH Q8 Q&A).\n\nReal time release testing The ability to evaluate and ensure the quality of in-process and/or final product based on process data, which typically include a valid combination of measured material attributes and process controls.

        text: 'Samples are retained to fulfil two purposes; firstly to provide a sample for analytical testing and secondly to provide a specimen of the fully finished product. Samples may therefore fall into two categories:


          Reference sample: a sample of a batch of starting material, packaging material or finished product which is stored for the purpose of being analyzed should the need arise during the shelf life of the batch concerned. Where stability permits, reference samples from critical intermediate stages (e.g. those requiring analytical testing and release) or intermediates that are transported outside of the manufacturer’s control should be kept.


          Retention sample: a sample of a fully packaged unit from a batch of finished product. It is stored for identification purposes. For example, presentation, packaging, labelling, patient information leaflet, batch number, expiry date should the need arise during the shelf life of the batch concerned. There may be exceptional circumstances where this requirement can be met without retention of duplicate samples e.g. where small amounts of a batch are packaged for different markets or in the production of very expensive medicinal products.


          For finished products, in many instances the reference and retention samples will be presented identically, i.e. as fully packaged units. In such circumstances, reference and retention samples may be regarded as interchangeable.'
